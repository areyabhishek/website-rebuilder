Henry Ford quipped that people would have asked for faster horses, not automobiles. Yet at Linear, we just built a feature specifically designed to collect customer requests. Seems contradictory, right?\nIt's not. Here's why.\n#### [The feedback paradox⁠](https://linear.app/now/building-what-customers-need\\#the-feedback-paradox)\nProduct teams face a fundamental tension. Build only what customers ask for and risk mediocrity. Ignore feedback entirely and risk irrelevance. Every product decision exists within this practical challenge.\nThe most innovative products emerged without explicit customer requests. Nobody asked for the first iPhone, Airbnb, or Figma. These products came from vision and intuition.\nMeanwhile, the graveyard of failed startups contains countless visionary products nobody wanted.\n#### [Feedback sharpens intuition⁠](https://linear.app/now/building-what-customers-need\\#feedback-sharpens-intuition)\nAt Linear, we believe the best products come from strong opinions informed by customer reality. Customer feedback serves as the whetstone that sharpens intuition, rather than the source of product vision.\nUsers rarely articulate their core problems directly. They describe symptoms, request features they’ve seen elsewhere, or suggest solutions that address their specific need but wouldn't serve the broader user base effectively.\nWhen a user asks for \"custom fields,\" they're expressing a deeper need that requires interpretation. Just as a doctor doesn't make accurate diagnoses by collecting more patient self-diagnoses, product teams don't create successful products by simply amassing feature requests.\nThe magic happens in the interpretation. The most valuable skill in product development lies in understanding what remains unsaid, beyond the explicit feedback.\n### [Why we built Customer Requests⁠](https://linear.app/now/building-what-customers-need\\#why-we-built-customer-requests)\nSo, why build [Customer Requests](https://linear.app/customer-requests) if raw feedback alone misses the mark?\nCustomer feedback, when collected thoughtfully, organized intelligently, and interpreted skillfully, becomes a powerful intuition amplifier.\n#### [Feedback becomes fragmented at scale⁠](https://linear.app/now/building-what-customers-need\\#feedback-becomes-fragmented-at-scale)\nWe observed a consistent pattern across growing companies. When teams are small, customer understanding happens naturally. Engineers chat directly with users, support teams recognize repeat requests, and everyone develops an intuitive feel for customer priorities through proximity.\nBut scale changes everything. Customer conversations multiply and fragment across email threads, support tickets, Slack messages, app store reviews, and research calls. What was once a clear signal becomes buried in noise. The small-company systems that worked at the start begin to fail under this volume.\nCapturing feedback isn't the problem. Sales teams use Gong, support uses Intercom, and product teams maintain separate research repositories. The challenge appears when product teams need to use this feedback. They spend hours navigating multiple systems, many of which they lack access to, trying to piece together fragmented context.\n> I love seeing customer feedback — it brings our work to life. While we get great insights from UX interviews and our customer-facing teams, sometimes valuable feedback gets stuck in tools I can't access.\nMaja Waite — Engineering Manager, Multiverse\nWhen product teams lack deep customer understanding, they explore paths that don't address core customer problems. For larger companies especially, this creates significant waste — engineering resources go toward features that customers don't need while crucial problems remain unsolved.\n#### [Reading between our _own_ lines⁠](https://linear.app/now/building-what-customers-need\\#reading-between-our-own-lines)\nWe experienced this pattern firsthand. When users requested \"custom fields,\" we dug deeper to understand the underlying need rather than implementing the feature at face value. Conversations with users revealed that approximately 40% wanted these fields specifically to track customer needs. Adding a simple custom field felt like a bandaid to a bigger problem — instead, we created something purpose-built that solves this specific problem exceptionally well — a dedicated workflow connecting customer context directly to product decisions.\nWe created a dedicated space in Linear, displaying customer context alongside engineering work. Customer needs weren't just abstract requests anymore, and they didn't get buried. These were real companies with real people, positioned alongside actionable engineering work.\n> Support tools often have the highest density of customer feedback. When product and support teams get closer together, and the systems between them are smooth, magical things happen.\nMarty Kausas — Co-founder, Pylon\nOur Customer Requests feature brings feedback from support tickets, Slack messages, and calls directly into Linear – where product and engineering teams can spot patterns, interpret needs, and build context that informs decisions.\nWe designed it to move beyond tallying votes for features — providing teams with concrete data to recognize patterns and build products users actually need.\nCustomer Requests enables teams to:\n- Bring the voice of customer directly into product development\n- Prioritize high-impact needs by filtering customers by revenue, tier, and other business metrics\n- Replace scattered tracking methods and eliminate manual syncing between tools\n#### [Where we're heading⁠](https://linear.app/now/building-what-customers-need\\#where-we're-heading)\nWhen we started building Customer Requests, we set out to solve a clear problem — help growing companies stay as close to their customers as they were when small.\nWe're working on integrating with Salesforce and HubSpot so teams can capture customer context where they already work. We'll use AI to help teams find the signal through the noise and make sense of all this feedback.\nThe best products emerge when strong vision meets deep customer understanding. Pure customer-led development and isolated visionary thinking both fall short of consistently producing breakthrough products. Develop your product intuition by immersing yourself in customer feedback while trusting your ability to see patterns and needs they cannot articulate. Treat customer requests as input, not instructions.\nSagan Schultz\n·March 04, 2025\nCopy link"

Among all the variables that compose our environment, the tooling we choose has a profound impact on the work we do, and, in the best case scenario, becomes a standard for how we build products. This is why we put so much care into even the tiniest details in Linear.\nToday, we are revealing the result of many weeks of work redesigning Linear’s interface. We’ve adjusted the sidebar, tabs, headers, and panels to reduce visual noise, maintain visual alignment, and increase the hierarchy and density of navigation elements. These changes make space for Linear to evolve from a simple issue tracker into a purpose-built system for product development.\n![Introducing the new Linear UI](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/900ab5bbf41d4245dcd32122b80ed523c5a00e2f-2352x1344.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)\n![Introducing the new Linear UI](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/fbe1a0ae325c93e6ae1c9ec94a63607940408e05-2352x1344.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)\nRead on to learn how we went from concept to redesign in a few weeks."

          "content": "Karri Saarinen, Co-founder\nAs I outlined in [part one](https://linear.app/blog/a-design-reset), there is never a good time to do a redesign. Normally these projects require a team of 5-7 people, but when I started seeing the need, our product and design team were busy with ongoing projects. We only had three product designers for the web and desktop platforms at the time, and even pulling just one of them into this project would have stalled several other workstreams. That wasn’t something I wanted to do.\nAn opportunity presented itself when I returned from my parental leave last summer. The company was functioning mostly without my direct involvement. This created a window of time where I could get started on the concept design myself. So, I opened Figma and began to explore.\nThe most pressing problems seemed to be:\n1. Accommodating the product evolution\n2. Enhancing the clarity of the application chrome and views\n3. Improving the navigation\nWhile I initially delved into all three areas, I eventually set aside navigation as it became clear the problems were complex and no longer solely a design issue. Any updates would require significant engineering work and change how users interacted with the product. This felt like an unnecessary risk and would expand the scope, so I made the call to focus purely on a redesign.\nEven when doing concept work, you often need to focus your efforts. The design concept should feel like an exciting evolution of the product. A redesign should not completely disassemble the product to its atomic parts. While you might have ambitious goals, you also have to be realistic and manage risks.\nI started to focus on this inverted L-shape. It's the global chrome of the application that controls the content in the main view.\n![Inverted L navigation highlighted](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/73b5bcd3d1d73d0b15322d5cbb57c0aae7ff7b5f-2352x1380.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)\n![Inverted L navigation highlighted](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/6910ef17f5a9ace0abf9399172e785e358f54db5-2352x1380.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)\nI didn't adhere to a specific method during the exploration phase, but typically, each day I designed a complete set of screens and flows. One day might be dedicated to designing the Inbox view, while the next day I could focus on the roadmap and projects. Other days, I explored upcoming product features. During this process, I experimented with different iterations of the sidebar, visual styles, and colors, and then linked the screens together as a prototype to assess their functionality.\nThrough this process, I generated hundreds of screens and was able to narrow down a few major directions that resonated most. Around this time, I began sharing the screens with other designers and people within the company to gather feedback and additional insights.\n![Karri's explorations in Figma](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/bdcbe466b6d17e5b540f02027b924fd2eea947a6-2352x1298.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)\n![Karri's explorations in Figma](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/7f5178a3de744d905655ebe8cf43dea6b879ed85-2352x1298.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)\nKarri's explorations in Figma\nUltimately, we settled on the main design direction, and I created a few views to showcase it.\nThe concept had taken shape. Now, it was time to bring it to life."

We didn’t know how we would bridge the previous UI design with the new style or if the new design could support all of our application states and options. We were able to make some changes off the bat, such as updating the color system, while other changes had to be punted to later on, such as the different headers you come across while navigating the app.\nTo help spark conversation and speed up decisions, we had two people tackle two different design parts of the project simultaneously. While I was building out the prototypes, I referenced example screens that showed the new visual language so I stayed true to the north star. I kept asking myself, “How real could this concept car be?” and then pushed during the tests to get as close to it as possible.\n![Before](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/ccd9419e69dfb07ef7114c8ee249ce2453218752-2352x1380.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)\n![Before](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/23839a6bacba4a7617728dada3d37a40dc3584aa-2352x1380.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)\nBefore\n![Concept](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/89114c00b0c022ea3430038754a8ad1ca3e350a9-2352x1672.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)\n![Concept](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/ea3d9f931653fa9de5bd71269e5abf471a0f7eb5-2352x1672.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)\nConcept\n![After](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/9b91020243984487b4e0cbe72278dd1acd7f9c57-2352x1380.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)\n![After](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/2ef6f0599f502940b18eae2c37a1fbd9ee09be25-2352x1380.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)\nAfter"

          "content": "Yann-Edern Gillet, Design\nIt’s easy for the scope of UI redesign projects to blow up. Before we got too far down any one path, we needed to get some confidence on the right option to keep everyone focused. So we ran some stress tests (or crash tests if you want to be dramatic) before going into implementation and iterating with engineers. We tested three main focus areas: the environment, the appearance, and the hierarchy.\n### [1\\. Environment⁠](https://linear.app/now/how-we-redesigned-the-linear-ui\\#1.-environment)\nYann-Edern Gillet, Design\nOur app runs on Electron, so our navigation needed to work not just on macOS and Windows as a native app but also in any browser. That meant that previous/next navigation buttons, history, and tabs needed to be easily removable to work with browsers. We tested a lot of options, from very condensed to more spacious configurations. I often relied on Apple standards, which also helped get close to the feeling of a native app.\n![Linear on macOS, Windows, and in a browser](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/2647bee66bc2fd362329d49b4ecd1e47ac5f8e01-2352x2352.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)\n![Linear on macOS, Windows, and in a browser](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/988d7a80fea7432e77f1fb3429bda68e9ef8057a-2352x2352.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)\nLinear on macOS, Windows, and in a browser\nI also spent time aligning labels, icons, and buttons, both vertically and horizontally in the sidebar and tabs. It was definitely a challenge given the amount of UI elements we have on this tiny surface. This part of the redesign isn’t something you’ll immediately see but rather something that you’ll feel after a few minutes of using the app.\n![Linear's sidebar alignments](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/88c9e424655d613e5ccd5e260b7cc1a692d3c068-2352x2808.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)\n![Linear's sidebar alignments](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/11d896d9d6ec5b3e1e2ae8ad6601a6765aac742f-2352x2808.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)\nSidebar alignments\n### [2\\. Appearance⁠](https://linear.app/now/how-we-redesigned-the-linear-ui\\#2.-appearance)\nYann-Edern Gillet, Design\nLinear is compatible with both light and dark modes, and we also provide a custom theme generator for users who want a unique look for their tools.\nKarri mostly worked with opacities of black and white during his explorations, which really helped him get results quickly and helped me understand the relationship he had in mind between the elements and their respective elevation and hierarchy. As our system relied on a set of variables, I worked with Andreas on our software engineering team to polish and iterate on both the core variables and the operations we apply to them to generate our aliases for surfaces, texts, icons, and controls.\nAndreas Eldh, Engineering\nA while back, we rebuilt the system for generating custom themes in Linear, using the [LCH color space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HCL_color_space) instead of HSL. LCH has the benefit that it’s perpetually uniform, meaning a red and a yellow color with lightness 50 will appear roughly equally light to the human eye. This makes it possible to generate more consistently good-looking themes, regardless of which base colors are used.\n![LCH vs. HSL](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/adb0eb0a91bbe06fef7a86c04eae2bbb6c3db4b6-2352x1616.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)\n![LCH vs. HSL](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/674c8e9db724ad23e44dcec70a0188aaca174fdc-2352x1616.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)\nLCH vs. HSL\nWe never fully rolled out this system, though. Custom themes in Linear kept using an HSL-based system to generate theme colors and the new system was only used for surfaces like elevated and translucent parts of Linear.\nWith this UI refresh, we started using the new theme generation system not only for custom themes but also for the main light and dark themes. So, instead of having to define 98 specific variables for each theme, we defined three: base color, accent color, and contrast.\nYes, the theme generation system also supports a contrast variable which defines how contrasty a theme should be. This allows us to automatically include super high-contrast themes for users who need it for accessibility reasons.\n![Comparison between contrast set to 30 and 100 in Linear](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/e04450c28ffcd568133b813c86151089ada9189d-2352x2488.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)\n![Comparison between contrast set to 30 and 100 in Linear](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/5082e6f59a13b030196e7de596aa26e82163dd74-2352x2488.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)\nComparison between contrast set to 30 and 100 in Linear\nWe kept using LCH for our theme generation, as it is one of the closest color spaces to the human eye and allowed us to deal with different elevations for our surfaces (e.g. background, foreground, panels, dialogs, and modals).\nWe migrated the light and dark themes to adopt the same theme generation, so it was easier for Yann and me to share the same language and iterate.\n![Our new light and dark themes](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/b7551ae44d0365c0ed87d7e5e23aeb0421233ba5-2352x1656.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)\n![Our new light and dark themes](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/4440f7f7cd02950e5e71be841b9cdbf20ec7a9c5-2352x1656.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)\nOur new light and dark themes\n### [3\\. Hierarchy⁠](https://linear.app/now/how-we-redesigned-the-linear-ui\\#3.-hierarchy)\nYann-Edern Gillet, Design\nLinear relies on a set of structured layouts that support the navigation elements and content. It integrates additional headers to store filters and display options, side panels to display meta properties, as well as the actual display: list, board, timeline, split, and fullscreen.\nWhen I joined the project, Karri had already gathered most of the app's views and their respective states, so I was able to run all of my tests quite effectively. I mostly worked by type of view (list, board, split, etc.) as I found it easier to focus and ensure that every decision worked in all cases.\n![Some of the views being tested with the new UI](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/6f49fe3e5f0efea0a4c496abd1ed7000a0a19184-2352x1710.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)\n![Some of the views being tested with the new UI](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/6f49fe3e5f0efea0a4c496abd1ed7000a0a19184-2352x1710.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)\nSome of the views being tested with the new UI"

We also improved the appearance and contrast of our theme for light and dark modes. We used a feature flag to allow for internal testing at this stage.\n4. **Private beta**: We started rolling out the new design in Private beta to get initial feedback. Once we felt comfortable, we began rolling out the changes to a percentage of workspaces each day.\n5. **GA:** We released the new UI to all workspaces.\nWe also have to give a shoutout to all the friends of Linear for their feedback throughout the entire process."

Otherwise, you will block almost every project and create design debt as newly added features and screens need to be redesigned very soon after they are created. Once we had the initial direction in place, we focused a small team on the redesign: Romain and Yann led the efforts with contributions from Andreas, Adrien, and the full Linear design team.\nRomain Cascino, Engineering\nWe knew that in order to move quickly and ship our work successfully, we needed to dedicate time and team resources to it. We couldn’t treat it as a side project. All in all, the redesign project took about six weeks to complete.\nWe kicked off the project at an offsite in Athens earlier this year, where we tackled a big chunk of the initial work, most notably on the sidebar, tabs, and different levels of headers.\nEach afternoon, we divided the coding portions into groups of two engineers while designers iterated on other parts of the project, building a pipeline for us to work from. This daily back-and-forth between designers and engineers helped us get the first working version of the new UI by the end of the week. The result of that week’s work was added to a feature flag that allowed everyone else at Linear to start testing the new UI.\nYann-Edern Gillet, Design\nNext, we worked on the Inbox. We redesigned notifications to be more centered around the notification type and emphasized the faces of your teammates. We simplified headers and filters to improve the overall navigation. We also reviewed comments alignments and harmonized the look of our buttons with the new themes.\nWe continued polishing the new color theme with Andreas to increase the overall contrast and return to a more neutral and timeless appearance. The latter was achieved by limiting how much chrome (blue in our case) was used in the calculations applied to our color system. The contrast of the content has also been improved by making our text and neutral icons darker in light mode and lighter in dark mode.\nWe started using Inter Display to add more expression to our headings while maintaining their readability and kept using regular Inter for the rest of the text elements."

They can be @mentioned, delegated issues through assignment, create and reply to comments, collaborate on projects and documents, etc. App users are installed and managed by workspace admins.\nYou can build agents for internal use within your own workspace or for distribution to other organizations. It does not cost anything to develop agents in Linear. To make your agent available to other workspaces, [submit](https://linear.app/docs/integration-directory#submit-your-integration) your agent to Linear's integration directory.\nAdditionally, agents installed in your workspace do not count as billable users.\nWe've created a demo agent built on our Typescript SDK and Cloudflare, if you want to dive straight into an example codebase.\n[Weather Bot](https://github.com/linear/weather-bot) is an agent that will help you look up the weather of any location within a Linear issue."

Enabling this category will notify your webhook when events occur that are directly relevant to your app's user.\nNote that the name and icon of your application will be how the agent appears in workspaces where it is installed (e.g. in the mention and filter menus), so it is best to choose something short, recognizable, but unique.\nIf you're just getting started, selecting Inbox notifications and Permission changes may also be helpful. You can read more about these in [Interaction Best Practices](https://linear.app/developers/agent-best-practices)."

          "content": "### [Actor and scopes⁠](https://linear.app/developers/agents\\#actor-and-scopes)\nApp authentication is built on top of the standard [OAuth2](https://linear.app/developers/oauth-2-0-authentication) flow. To install your agent into a Linear workspace in the OAuth authorization url add the `actor=app` parameter to switch to an app installation rather than requesting authentication as the installing user. Because this will be installed with a workspace scope _admin permissions are required_ to complete the installation.\nThis new actor type supersedes any references to `actor=application` and can be used for all agent, app, and service account use-cases.\n#### [Mention + assign scopes⁠](https://linear.app/developers/agents\\#mention-+-assign-scopes)\nTo allow for flexibility, the ability to mention and assign your agent is optional and must be requested through the use of two new additional scopes added to the `scope` query parameter:\n| Scope | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| app:assignable | Allow the app to be assigned as a delegate on issues and made a member of projects |\n| app:mentionable | Allow the app to be mentioned in issues, documents, and other editor surfaces |\nAssigning an issue to your app now sets it as the `delegate`, not the `assignee`—so humans maintain ownership while agents act on their behalf.\n#### [Customer access scopes⁠](https://linear.app/developers/agents\\#customer-access-scopes)\nThe ability to access customer-related entities in your workspace for your agent must be requested through scopes:\n| Scope | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| customer:read | Allow the app to read customer data in the workspace |\n| customer:write | Allow the app to read and write customer data in the workspace |\n#### [Initiative access scopes⁠](https://linear.app/developers/agents\\#initiative-access-scopes)\nThe ability to access initiative-related entities in your workspace for your agent must be requested through scopes:\n| Scope | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| initiative:read | Allow the app to read initiative data in the workspace |\n| initiative:write | Allow the app to read and write initiative data in the workspace |\n#### [Admin⁠](https://linear.app/developers/agents\\#admin)\nNote that integrations using the `actor=app` mode are not able to also request `admin` scope.\n### [Installation⁠](https://linear.app/developers/agents\\#installation)\nYour app will have a _unique ID for each workspace_ it is installed within, you can find this ID with the following query using the OAuth access token received as part of the installation flow:\n```Codeblock-module__NYCDmG__code\nquery Me {\n  viewer {\n    id\n  }\n}\n```\nWe highly recommend storing this ID alongside your access token so that you can confidently identify your app in different workspaces.\n### [Management⁠](https://linear.app/developers/agents\\#management)\nThe team access available to your app can be changed or revoked at any time by workspace admins. If you're subscribed to the **Permission changes** webhook category, a `PermissionChange` webhook will be sent when access changes occur."

          "content": "Once installed and authenticated, your agent is ready to interact in the workspace. The core interaction model centers around the [**Agent Session**](https://linear.app/developers/agent-interaction#agent-session), which tracks the lifecycle of a given agent task. Sessions are created automatically when an agent is mentioned or delegated an issue.\nSession state is visible to users, and updated automatically based on the agent’s emitted activities. No manual state management is required.\n### [Receiving your first webhook⁠](https://linear.app/developers/agents\\#receiving-your-first-webhook)\nThe most common entry point is delegation—when a user assigns an issue to your agent.\nThis triggers a `created` AgentSessionEvent webhook containing an `agentSession` object with the relevant issue, comment, and context.\nTo get started, your agent should:\n- Emit a `thought` activity within 10 seconds to acknowledge the session has begun\n- Inspect the `issue`, `comment`, `previousComments`, and `guidance` fields\nDetails on the Agent Session webhook structure and how to respond using Agent Activities in [Developing the Agent Interaction](https://linear.app/developers/agent-interaction).\n[Previous\\\\\n\\\\\nAgent Interaction Guidelines (AIG)](https://linear.app/developers/aig) [Next\\\\\n\\\\\nDeveloping the Agent Interaction](https://linear.app/developers/agent-interaction)"
