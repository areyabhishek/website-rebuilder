Fortunately, the quick results to my middle aged, mother of three, too much sugar body have kept me motivated. My program works, the trainer is excellent, worth the sweat and the cash.”\nJoannie N.\n“I just started with Custom Fit last week. Two sessions in and I am hooked. I have not been to a gym or had a personal trainer in 20+ years, so I was very nervous about it considering that I am fairly unfit. I've partnered up with Anthony Dandrea as my trainer and it's been nothing short of amazing. The facilities are great.”\nRory G.\n“I really enjoy that my wife and I can go in for couples sessions. We love working out together, and Evan makes it really fun for both of us, even though our goals are different.”\nChris M.\n“Awesome experience working with Evan & team at Custom Fit SF for partner training. The gym is conveniently located, clean, well-organized and super functional for strength and circuit workouts. Lots of fun equipment to mix up workouts (sled, battle ropes, kettlebells, etc.) and for recovery (massage guns, foam rollers, etc.).”\nJames H.\n“Fantastic studio gym that has everything you need and no crowds. I've been working with a fantastic trainer (Lu Green) for 7-8 months and I could not be happier with the progress. All the staff/trainers at the gym have been nice and helpful, and do a great job of creating a safe and hardworking environment for everyone.”\nErik S.\n“I bought a pack of 20 sessions here and it was definitely worth it. +1 on the review below that it's a very unpretentious atmosphere and a great space (and very clean).”“I bought a pack of 20 sessions here and it was definitely worth it. +1 on the review below that it's a very unpretentious atmosphere and a great space (and very clean).”\n“I bought a pack of 20 sessions here and it was definitely worth it. +1 on the review below that it's a very unpretentious atmosphere and a great space (and very clean).”\nEric T."

Our approach is rooted in data, driven by expertise, and refined through years of helping people move better, feel stronger, and live with greater vitality.\nWe start with a deep understanding of your body — because that’s where precision begins. From **DEXA scans** that break down your body composition, to ‍ **VO2 Max** and ‍ **Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR)** testing that reveal your physiological engine, to ‍ **3D gait analysis** and ‍ **VALD force plate diagnostics** that analyze how you move — everything we do is informed by ‍ **evidence, not guesswork**. These tools aren’t reserved for elite athletes. They’re here to give everyday humans elite-level insight into how to ‍ **train smarter, eat better, and recover more effectively**.\nBut we don’t stop at the data. Your results are guided by a multidisciplinary team of **coaches, registered dietitians, physical therapists, and performance specialists** who collaborate to build a strategy around your goals, preferences, and lifestyle.

Our testing services empower you to train smarter, recover better, and optimize body composition over time.\n##### DEXA Scanning\nOur on-site DEXA (Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry) scans are the gold standard for measuring body composition—including fat mass, lean mass, and bone density—with clinical-grade accuracy. We use DEXA not only to assess starting points but also to track progress and inform training and nutrition adjustments. With clear visuals, regional breakdowns, and expert interpretation with every scan, your DEXA results becomes a roadmap—not just a snapshot. DEXA scans are ideal for anyone looking to make meaningful, measurable change in their body composition or performance.\n**Book a DEXA scan** [**HERE**](https://customfit.gymmasteronline.com/portal/signup/10)\n##### VO2 Max + rmr testing\nWe offer advanced metabolic testing to help you understand your physiology on a deeper level. Our VO2 Max test reveals your aerobic capacity and training zones, while the Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR) test measures how many calories your body burns at rest. Together, they give us a complete view of how you use oxygen and energy—allowing us to fine-tune your training and nutrition plan for fat loss, endurance, or performance. These tools transform guesswork into precision for athletes and everyday clients alike.\n**Book a VO2 + RMR** [**HERE**](https://customfit.gymmasteronline.com/portal/signup/12)\n##### 3d Gait Analysis\nOur 3D Gait Analysis goes beyond what the eye (or camera) can see—capturing every joint angle, stride length, and movement pattern as you run. Using 3D motion capture technology, we assess how your lower body moves in real time to identify asymmetries, inefficiencies, or compensation patterns. Whether you’re an avid runner, recovering from injury, or looking to improve performance and prevent future issues, this data helps us design targeted strength and mobility interventions. It’s one of the most precise tools in modern movement analysis—and it’s available right here in-house.\n**Book a 3D Gait Analysis** [**HERE**](https://book.stripe.com/8wM3fZ0Vnfqg8Ks4gp)\n##### Advanced Bloodwork\nCustom Fit partners with local MD Jahan Fahimi and an in-house phlebotomist to offer advanced blood testing that provides a complete picture of your internal health. From nutrient deficiencies and inflammation markers to hormonal panels and metabolic health indicators, our team uses your lab data to inform your training, nutrition, and recovery protocols. Every test is reviewed by a Registered Dietitian, with the option to upgrade to an MD consultation, where you’ll receive a personalized action plan based on real biomarkers—not speculation. It’s the future of performance and preventative health, integrated into your Custom Fit experience.\n**Get started with Bloodwork** [**HERE**](https://buy.stripe.com/4gwg2L6fHfqg2m48wA)\n##### VALD Force Deck Testing\nOur VALD force plate system provides elite-level neuromuscular diagnostics—measuring asymmetries, rate of force development, and reactive strength in real time. Whether you’re rehabbing an injury, returning to sport, or pursuing peak power output, these plates give us hard data to inform your program. We use the force deck to test squat patterns, jumping mechanics, balance, and more—all interpreted by our Thomas of VeRT Studio to guide safe, effective progression. It’s objective, fast, and invaluable for athletes and serious trainees.\n**Inquire about VALD Testing** [**HERE**](mailto:hello@customfitsf.com?subject=VALD%20Force%20Deck%20Inquiry)"

Growing up on a farm, I learned about the origins of the food on our table and spent hours in the kitchen with my grandmother.\n‍\nWhen I became ill in high school, my perspective shifted, and I began to see food as medicine, recognizing its ability to energize and support our bodies. I now love modifying recipes to meet different dietary needs, proving that nutritious food can also be delicious.\n‍\nMy practice today combines my experience as a dietitian with my background in personal training to guide clients toward their performance goals. My own love of movement began with weightlifting during undergrad, and I’m currently enjoying the world of triathlons.\n‍\nMy approach focuses on delivering evidence-based nutrition strategies, promoting optimal physical performance, and fostering a strong, positive relationship with food and movement.\n‍\nI take a holistic approach to counseling, focusing not just on nutrition but also on movement, sleep, stress management, and hydration. My goal is to empower you to make food you love an integral part of a balanced and fulfilling lifestyle.

This lead me to dive deeper into science and medicine, pursue an education in nutrition and become a registered dietitian.

Born and raised in the Bay Area, I love learning and being immersed in the inspiring and innovative food scene that we are world famous for. Before studying to become a nutritionist I worked in the restaurant industry for 10 years, so my passion for food is not only focused on health, but being delicious as well! I love learning, researching, and testing new recipes that utilize local and seasonal ingredients, are easy to make, and most importantly taste great.

As an avid surfer, I've been able to use my knowledge and experience to improve my own eating habits around performance and daily living. Along with consistent training, mindful practices like yoga and meditation, and a balanced approach to eating, I continually see improvements both in and out of the water.\n‍\nWhen we nourish and treat our bodies well, we get the most out of ourselves.

Having fallen in love with basketball as a young kid, I set out to become the best athlete I could, hoping to one day play sports professionally. Limited knowledge of how to train for sport and properly refuel and rest my body slowly wore me down physically, resulting in many ailments, movement compensations and lingering pain. Seeking remedy for my own issues, I gained inspiration to dedicate my learning more about the human body, proper training technique and nutrition, to better serve others towards achieving their desired results. I use these pillars to create fun, strategic and systematic training programs, while striving to always be a student who never feels their learning is complete.\n**‍**\n**Certifications and Education:**\nNational Academy of Sports Medicine - Certified Personal Trainer (CPT)\nNational Academy of Sports Medicine - Corrective Exercise Specialist (CES)\nNational Academy of Sports Medicine - Performance Enhancement Specialist (PES)\nTrainers\nJames Coca\nPersonal Trainer\n![Jen Rubin](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67812e9aadaf2839969ac63f/67d05b690cb913284e89c310_Jen%20Rubin.png)\nJen Rubin\nPersonal Trainer\nI’m a Bay Area Native from Mill Valley. Growing up I spent my free time skateboarding, hiking, kayaking, body-surfing & swimming. I have always led an active healthy lifestyle and am constantly finding ways to challenge my body.\nIn my mid 20s I was struck with Celiac, this diagnosis forced me to adopt a disciplined diet (100% gluten free) and pushed me further into my fitness passion. Fortunately, it led me deeper into understanding the mind-body connection and enhanced my fitness lifestyle. This situation changed my perspective on work-life balance and wellbeing. I wanted a career that focused on health & wellness which led me to become a Certified Personal Trainer.\n‍\nI have worked with many different clients, from de-conditioned working professionals, to retired athletes, to aging adults. My fitness beliefs revolve around having body awareness, understanding the dynamic between exercise, nutrition, and using movement as medicine. I structure my training to safely & effectively help my clients become strong. My goal is to help you boost your confidence, build and maintain strength and create a balanced lifestyle with a training program you will stick to consistently and also enjoy. I want you to look good and feel good! Outside of work I love to cook, bake, travel, explore the outdoors, and listen to music from classic rock to blues to hip hop and reggae.

My ideal client is anyone with a goal, a positive attitude, and a willingness to work hard.\n‍\n\\\\My love for fitness started when I was in high school competing in sports such as football and basketball. It was during this time that I learned the importance of exercise and proper nutrition. I became aware of how it had an impact on my overall health and wellness. I attended Central Michigan University to earn my bachelors degree in Exercise Science. From there I developed my passion to help other people obtain their highest quality of life via fitness.\n‍\nI have over 16 years of experience as a trainer. From training individual clients to large groups, I’m also experienced with sports performance training and working in physical therapy clinics. My career has led me to take on several management positions in corporate fitness clubs. I’ve coached and mentored other trainers, helping them to develop skills and build successful businesses.

That's the quote that I live by to this day. Being a Mexican native and a daughter of two immigrant parents, fitness was never a priority. Yes, I grew up playing sports such as soccer and track, but school was always number one. When I came out to San Francisco in 2016 to pursue my dream as an artist, I realized it was going to be much harder than I thought. I developed a lot of stress because of school and found my outlet in the gym. I started my journey not knowing much but stayed committed. I went in every day even after 8-12 hour painting sessions to let my body move and react in ways it never did before. Starting at just 100 lbs, I changed my eating habits, became more aware of my body's needs, and actually listened to those signs and gained 30 lbs in the process. I have become who I wanted to be, feeling strong, understanding movement patterns and now I can help others.\n‍\nMy goal as a personal trainer and fitness advocate is to help others move well, move pain-free, and move freely. I program with needs and wants in mind and believe that building strength and mobility is the key to pain-free moving. Whether you are looking to gain or lose weight, increase flexibility and mobility, body build, work on endurance or simply want to move well, I know we can work on those things together and get you to where you want to be and then some.\n‍\n**Certifications:**\nAmerican Council on Exercise (ACE) - Certified Personal Trainer\nAmerican Council on Exercise (ACE) - Corrective Exercise Specialist\nAssisted Stretching Certified\nTrainers\nLizzy Lemus\nPersonal Trainer \\| Assisted Stretching Specialist\n![Mya Elkins](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67812e9aadaf2839969ac63f/67d05c7efc81f0d2b6e137a3_Mya%20Elkins.png)\nMya Elkins\nPersonal Trainer \\| Front Desk \\| Run Club Coach\nI’ve always been active but even as a three-season athlete in high school, I struggled with my weight, weighing over 200lbs.

Starting to compete in strongman and powerlifting is what drove me to getting my certifications. I found that by helping people get stronger and bring up their weak points, it had a lot of carry over into their everyday life. Outside of competing, my true passion is helping people, and the best way I have found to do that is by building confidence through exercise.

I work on strength and mobility to make sure everyone can move throughout their days without any pain or discomfort.\n‍\nWhether your goal is to lose/gain weight, work on mobility, endurance, to train with an injury, or just to feel better over all, I will be there to support and guide you.\n‍\n**Certifications & Education**\nISSA - Certified Personal Trainer\nTrainers\nJonathan Rivera\nPersonal Trainer \\| Assisted Stretching Specialist\n![Johnny Kunstadter](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67812e9aadaf2839969ac63f/67d4697e9339ef15aa956a7b_johnny%20kunstadter.png)\nJohnny Kunstadter\nPersonal Trainer\nI grew up playing sports, but it wasn't until after high school that I began to form a real understanding of strength and athletic training. Before I became a personal trainer, I trained and participated in combat sports (primarily submission grappling but also kickboxing and MMA) as both a competitor and a coach.

We love working out together, and Evan makes it really fun for both of us, even though our goals are different.”\nChris M.\n“Awesome experience working with Evan & team at Custom Fit SF for partner training. The gym is conveniently located, clean, well-organized and super functional for strength and circuit workouts. Lots of fun equipment to mix up workouts (sled, battle ropes, kettlebells, etc.) and for recovery (massage guns, foam rollers, etc.).”\nJames H.\n“Fantastic studio gym that has everything you need and no crowds. I've been working with a fantastic trainer (Lu Green) for 7-8 months and I could not be happier with the progress. All the staff/trainers at the gym have been nice and helpful, and do a great job of creating a safe and hardworking environment for everyone.”\nErik S.\n“I bought a pack of 20 sessions here and it was definitely worth it. +1 on the review below that it's a very unpretentious atmosphere and a great space (and very clean).”“I bought a pack of 20 sessions here and it was definitely worth it. +1 on the review below that it's a very unpretentious atmosphere and a great space (and very clean).”\n“I bought a pack of 20 sessions here and it was definitely worth it. +1 on the review below that it's a very unpretentious atmosphere and a great space (and very clean).”\nEric T.\n“This is easily the best gym you can find in San Francisco. They have all the equipment I need, it's never busy and the location is very convenient.”\nAlexander T.\n“I wish I could say I don't need a personal trainer but I do. Fortunately, the quick results to my middle aged, mother of three, too much sugar body have kept me motivated. My program works, the trainer is excellent, worth the sweat and the cash.”\nJoannie N.\n“I just started with Custom Fit last week. Two sessions in and I am hooked. I have not been to a gym or had a personal trainer in 20+ years, so I was very nervous about it considering that I am fairly unfit. I've partnered up with Anthony Dandrea as my trainer and it's been nothing short of amazing. The facilities are great.”\nRory G."
