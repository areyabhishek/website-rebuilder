          "content": "In 2023, our focus for Appsmith was to get you to solutions more quickly by introducing features that address the needs of mid to large teams. We added features such as environments, which allow you to manage different stages of development, improved Git integration for easier collaboration and change tracking. And custom JS libraries to extend the functionality of your apps based on your needs.\nThese updates have helped businesses solve their challenges more effectively. For example, [HIFI](https://www.appsmith.com/case-studies/hifi) reduced their debugging time by 75% and their information tracking time by 50% using Appsmith. [GSK](https://www.appsmith.com/case-studies/gsk) developed an app in just one sprint to patch their fleet of 3,500 Linux Servers. And [EDIA](https://www.appsmith.com/case-studies/edia) reduced the time required to build a new collaborative platform by 80%.\nWe appreciate and hear your feedback, which is why we focused on improving stability, security, and support experience. Throughout the year, we resolved 5413 issues, made 5563 commits to our repositories, and merged 5118 pull requests to provide a robust and reliable platform for your Appsmith apps.\nAs part of our commitment to enterprise readiness, we introduced a new [usage-based pricing](https://www.appsmith.com/blog/usage-based-pricing) model, offering more flexibility and affordability. This allows teams to choose the pricing plan that best suits their requirements and pay for the features and resources they use.\nIn terms of numbers, we surpassed 120k apps published using Appsmith, indicating widespread adoption and usage. Additionally, we successfully hosted our first virtual conference, [Appsmith Innovate](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE_KXGiWfqwjGtp14coyFtAsZqmLg4VAH&si=OEOh3Yutvk8oLBk2), bringing more than 60 community members together to share knowledge and experiences."

          "content": "This year, Appsmith launched a new [Community Portal](https://community.appsmith.com/). It augments our Discord community, and offers a permanent home for training, tutorials, best practices, and other Appsmith content. Most importantly, it provides the opportunity for community members to contribute directly to this content library. Throughout the year, the portal saw the publication of several articles, showcasing the community's knowledge and expertise. We are grateful to community members like [Bobur](https://community.appsmith.com/a/boburumurzokov), pchambless, paulmcf87, etheric42, and dncpax for their valuable contributions in answering questions, helping others on Discord, and contributing to the Community Portal.\nThe Appsmith community grew significantly, with approximately 55% more Discord users joining the discussions. Our [GitHub stars increased from 23k to 30k](https://www.appsmith.com/blog/30k-stars-on-github), reflecting the recognition of Appsmith's capabilities and supportive community that has formed around our open source platform.\nTo encourage collaboration and knowledge sharing, we introduced the ability for community members to create and publish templates to the Community Portal. This allows you to showcase your use cases and provides inspiration for others. Additionally, the Appsmith team created 10 new templates, like the [customer support dashboard](https://www.appsmith.com/template/customer-support), [order fulfillment tracker](https://www.appsmith.com/template/order-fulfillment-tracker), [delivery service management](https://www.appsmith.com/template/delivery-service-management), and more.\nThroughout the year, we hosted our first virtual conference and shared [49 videos and hosted 39 livestreams](https://www.youtube.com/@appsmith), demonstrating the best use cases of Appsmith with technologies like MongoDB Atlas and Google Cloud Run.\nWe are immensely grateful for each and every member of the community and look forward to even more engagement in the coming year."

          "title": "What’s next in 2024?",
          "content": "In 2024, we will focus on improving the user experience and expanding Appsmith functionality. The focus will be to simplify the developer experience for new users and improve performance for viewers. We will introduce a variety of templates and case studies to inspire you and encourage your creativity. We are also planning innovative ways to engage with the community, including virtual events and opportunities for in-person meetings. Additionally, we are committed to empowering users with new features . Here are some upcoming features:\n### Auto-layout and custom UI\nWe will be shipping multiple features, but here are some key themes to look out for. First, we have our core value proposition of creating beautiful applications. With Appsmith, UI building has already become much easier. However, with our new Auto-Layout system, positioning, sizing, and alignment will be simplified to a whole new degree. This system will also improve UX by providing page layout options and making all applications accessible on any device, as the widgets will now react to different devices.\nWe also understand the importance of UI customization. We are working on a framework that will allow you to add new widgets to the platform. These widgets will maintain the same quality as our native widgets. Additionally, we are enhancing the framework to improve the teaming engine. This includes providing more theme customizability options and ensuring greater consistency.\n### Reusable Code\nWe understand that application development becomes much more efficient when you can reuse business logic and components across your applications. To facilitate this, we are introducing modules. Modules enable you to create custom reusable pieces of code, such as widgets, queries, or JavaScript, and package them into a single entity that can be shared across your application.\nFurthermore, you can version control and distribute these modules, as well as include them in your Git history. The best part about modules is that they function just like an MPM package.\n### CI/CD integration and Workflows\nWe understand that each team has its own unique set of software development lifecycle practices, and we believe that Appsmith should seamlessly integrate into those practices.\nTo achieve this, we are extending our integration to CI/CD. This means that we can receive webhooks and automatically trigger deployments on branches, allowing all of our application code to go live together. However, CI/CD is not the only workflow we are focusing on. We are excited to announce that we will also be launching [Workflow Automations](https://discord.com/channels/725602949748752515/725609493974614076/1188025030429376512).\nWorkflow automations are quite common, with many tools available. However, what makes Appsmith unique is our focus on automating human-in-the-loop tasks that require approvals. These workflows involve multiple steps and multiple users, such as KYC verification or refund approvals. We understand that building such workflows can be challenging.\nThat's why our workflows are developer-focused, just like everything else in Appsmith. This means that they are fully code-enabled, allowing you to refactor, modularize, and check-in via Git version control.\nWorkflow automations are currently in beta! You can sign up for the beta program [here](https://community.appsmith.com/content/blog/revolutionizing-automation-workflows)."

I've been directly involved in the growth of this category (low-code development) for the past decade and am incredibly excited about the opportunity here at Appsmith.\nRather than just write a LinkedIn update, I wanted to take a moment to reflect on what I've seen in the space, where it's going, and why I'm bullish on the Appsmith product and team."

          "content": "I had an opportunity to see the low-code market get established and evolve in the United States. I joined Outsystems just as they were expanding across North America. At that time, we were doing a lot of educating. The initial products early on in the space frankly weren't very good. There was a stigma in the market where buyers believed that there was too much \"black box\" to these tools, and they weren't capable of producing quality enterprise applications. We did a ton of work: multiple demos, POCs, onboarding services, etc. to win buyers over.\nAt the same time, we were really building a category. Analysts and buyers weren't thinking about low-code application platforms as a unique category and often tried to lump us into broader sets of infrastructure. We worked with the analysts to create a separate category definition and with our customers to establish a separate budget item for these tools.\nThe reality is that low-code development is a transformative technology. We were driving huge efficiencies at the companies we worked with and allowing them to build solutions that they never would have had the resources to build with their internal teams. We supported really complex initiatives across all verticals and industries."

          "content": "I saw the birth of this category, and now I've also seen it age. All enterprise software becomes bigger and more complex over time — it's a natural evolution. A desire to drive continued growth in a maturing market has led vendors to try and serve as many audiences as possible (think tooling for both citizen and professional developers in the same platform) and push pricing continually higher.\nThere are some tremendously powerful platforms that will always have a large foothold in the enterprise space, but at the same time, there are growing opportunities for tools at the department level that are a bit more purpose-built. Not everybody is really well-served by monolithic platforms (especially expensive ones), and I'm increasingly seeing teams look for things that are more specialized and lighter weight."

          "content": "Generative AI is already a significant disruptor in the low-code space. I'm not convinced that everyone's going to want to build applications through pure text prompt-writing, but vendors are going to have to figure out two things.\nOne, how AI can assist the development process and unlock even more engineering efficiency in large-scale projects. And secondly, and probably most importantly, how low-code vendors can help organizations build applications around AI and LLMs.\nThe way that users interact with data from an LLM is totally different compared to data from a traditional backend database. Low-code platforms that can help organizations build out these interactions will become the new leaders in this space."

These are people that I really wanted to work with. The fact that the Appsmith platform is open-source is also pretty unique.\nSome vendors, who I won't name here, are really getting out of control with pricing. They're taking advantage of the fact that customers are locked into the platform, and essentially holding them hostage.\nHaving an open-source alternative is a big deal. We give customers the right to own the applications they build, to inspect source code and directly contribute to the platform, and to move off of our commercial editions if we aren't serving them well. Open-source feels like a breath of fresh air in the space, and I'm excited to bring it to more customers."

Appsmith has a firm and growing presence in APAC and Europe, and we're starting to see some significant momentum in North America. For a number of years, I also had the pleasure to lead the LATAM region for Outsystems, and I see that as an additional expansion opportunity. One of the things that surprised me coming in was the number of established enterprise clients that are already using Appsmith. My goal is to help the team lean more into this segment.\nI'm also looking forward to meeting and interacting with the Appsmith community. There is an incredibly vibrant group of passionate supporters around the platform. You will be a key component of our continued success, so please reach out and say \"hi.\" I'd love to hear from you."

You must be able to support your customers across a growing variety of touch points — from sales channels, to email and helpdesk, realtime chat, and messaging, as well as in person. One customer service tool is often not enough to cover all of the touch points for an enterprise and its patrons.\nThis article explains the most important enterprise use cases for customer support platforms and lists the best customer service software tools available for 2025. It includes contact center, helpdesk, project management, and chatbot tools that your customer service staff can use to enhance your customer experience, and it shows how you can best leverage these tools to [build a single customer view](https://www.appsmith.com/use-case/single-customer-view) so that all of your customer data is readily available in one place."

They may wish to ask a question about your product before making a purchase, follow up on an order, or solve a problem with a previous purchase. Addressing customers’ issues quickly and accurately is paramount if you want their continued business and to maintain the good reputation of your company.\nDoing this manually is a non-starter. Even in the pre-digital age, there was always a system in place to streamline managing customer interactions: [rolodexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolodex), printed invoice and customer feedback templates, [carbon copies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_copy), [tickler files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tickler_file), etc. Fax, telephone, and pen-and-paper mechanisms were always being iterated on and improved, just like their digital successors.\nBelow we review the best customer service software for a variety of enterprise use cases and look at what they can do to improve your customer support experience."

          "content": "Chatbots have been around for a while and had a poor reputation for providing canned responses that weren’t always helpful. This has changed with the arrival of conversational AI platforms that respond in natural language.\nTraditional chatbots can follow predefined rules and scripts to respond to enquiries, allowing them to guide users and provide broad information. Conversational AI does much more than this, intelligently interpreting your customers’ questions using natural language processing (NLP), pulling information from your own documentation to construct the right answer, and implementing machine learning (ML) so that it can evolve its responses based on new information.\nChatbots and conversational AI let you scale your customer support processes. Often they can handle a large proportion of incoming enquiries, allowing your agents to focus on the most important, high-value customers and tasks.\n![Chatfuel, Manychat, Tars, and Botsify chatbot software comparison](https://www.appsmith.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Flpvian6u6i39%2F5MWnFls1684iP1qUXdxb9W%2F59397ff3691efdd895d3b27c4519c239%2Fimage__26_.png&w=3840&q=90)\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| Chatbot software | Pricing from |\n| [Chatfuel](https://chatfuel.com/) | $14.39 for 500 conversations, free trial for first bot |\n| [Manychat](https://manychat.com/) | Free |\n| [Tars](https://hellotars.com/) | Price on enquiry |\n| [Botsify](https://botsify.com/) | $49 for 2 chatbots, 14-day free trial |\n### Top Chatfuel features\n- Multi-agent responses: Multiple AI agent bots can work via a single WhatsApp number, improving response times\n- Abandoned cart recovery: Send personalized messages to customers to encourage them to [complete abandoned purchases](https://chatfuel.com/blog/7-chatbot-plugins-to-solve-common-ecommerce-store-problems)\n- ChatGPT integration: Sell products directly on WhatsApp using ChatGPT bots that can understand customers and complete transactions\n### Top Manychat features\n- Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp and SMS automation: Cross-platform chatbot that can automatically respond to customer queries\n- AI assistant: Use AI to help build your automations\n- Templates: Ready-to-go [conversation templates](https://manychat.com/blog/new-manychat-templates-for-chatbots/)\n### Top Tars features\n- Internal business use cases: [Provide self-service HR, payroll, and other administrative functions](https://hellotars.com/chatbot-templates) to your staff\n- Automation consulting: Tars will work with you to design solutions that optimize your workflows\n- Enterprise-grade security: Tars implements security best practices including zero trust and the principle of least privilege, and is compliant with regulations such as SOC 2, HIPAA, and GDPR\n### Top Botsify features\n- Drag-and-drop chatbot builder: Botsify allows anyone to [easily program](https://botsify.com/blog/chatbot-builder/) a chatbot\n- Third-party integrations: Connect to Slack, Shopify, Google Sheets, and other services\n- Agent fallback: Let a human take over if the chatbot fails to resolve the issue or a personal touch is required"

          "content": "These platforms are often specialized, so one tool is unlikely to do everything you need it to. Therefore, you need to consider the possible side effects of adopting a new tool into your larger workflows. If the tool works well, you will come to rely on it in the long term, moving your data into it and building your processes around it. You must look at the history and reputation of the vendor and make sure that they provide a path to moving your data out of their service — otherwise it will be difficult to migrate to another tool in the future if the quality suffers, the price rises, or its functionality falls behind its competitors.\nIf your workflows are highly bespoke and rely on custom implementation, take care to avoid [technical debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt). Relying on workarounds and quick fixes to keep your customer support infrastructure up and running could result in costly ongoing maintenance (or an abrupt halt to your customer service if things fall apart).\nYou must also think about your future needs: there may be something that a tool doesn't do that you don't need now, but if you’ll need it as your business grows, you should include it in your initial requirements."

          "content": "Some commercial software tools claim to be able to cover all of your customer support needs, but using a single tool comes with some risks. You lose choice and flexibility, you’re locked into _their_ way of doing things, and all of your eggs are in one basket — if the platform experiences a problem, your entire customer support process is dead in the water.\nEnterprises are increasingly eschewing the traditional approach of using a single commercial application to host their data and power their businesses. Instead, the trend is towards using multiple software tools and platforms: a combination of in-house software and best-in-class products to fill the specific role they are best suited for. This creates an ecosystem of business tools tailored to how _you_ do things, fitting with the best practices that work for your industry, employees, and customers.\nHowever, integrating multiple customer service tools into one location is much easier said than done. Fortunately, there are tools to help with this."

It provides a click-and-drag interface for placing UI widgets like buttons, tables, and form inputs, and connects to a [wide range of data sources](https://www.appsmith.com/integration) including popular customer support platforms. By using Appsmith you can choose the customer support tools that work best for you and unify the data they collect into a single customer support interface.\nApplications built with Appsmith can connect to data from your sales, support, helpdesk, and project management software. When a customer request comes in, your customer support team members can find the customer and immediately see all of their interactions with your business across different channels and platforms, as well as the internal status of their enquiry including internal notes. Your agents can then assess, prioritize, and rapidly respond to customer enquiries with up-to-date information.\nIf there is functionality that you require that isn't provided by a commercial tool, you can implement it yourself. You can use templates to accelerate the early stages of development, and test your Appsmith apps before deployment to ensure reliability.\n[Appsmith is free](https://app.appsmith.com/user/signup) and open source with no limitations (you can even [host it yourself](https://docs.appsmith.com/getting-started/setup)). For mission-critical applications you can sign up to our Business or Enterprise plans for [additional functionality and support](https://www.appsmith.com/pricing)."

This allows support teams to quickly match incoming customer enquiries with actions being taken by their technical teams and provide status updates and problem resolutions with a much shorter turnaround than using the Zendesk and Jira platforms separately.\nIf you want to see how Appsmith works in action, [we've put together a live coding session](https://www.youtube.com/live/GnpIcqI9Ei8?feature=shared) that shows how you can put together your own customer support solution in hours, not weeks."
