This includes completing all required training modules, passing all required assessments, and completing any mandatory evaluations or surveys. Once these steps are completed, your CPE certificate will be issued automatically.\n**Which Ramp Partner Academy courses offer CPE credits?**\nOnly certain courses are accredited for CPE. You’ll see a CPE reference in the course descriptions and on the thumbnail images. We’re continuously expanding our catalog, so check regularly for newly accredited courses.\n**Can I receive CPE credit for courses I completed before this program launched?**\nNo. Unfortunately, CPE credits are only issued for eligible courses completed after the launch of the CPE program. If you wish to earn credits, you will need to retake the course from the beginning to earn the CPE credit.\n**How do I access my CPE certificate once I complete a course?**\nAfter completing all course requirements, you’ll receive an email with your certificate of completion. You can also download your CPE certificate directly from your Partner Academy profile in the Credentials section.\n**Are the CPE credits issued by Ramp accepted by NASBA?**\nYes. Ramp is a registered sponsor with NASBA, and all CPE-accredited courses comply with NASBA’s standards. Once you’ve completed a course, your credits will be valid for reporting to your state licensing board, assuming they recognize NASBA-accredited providers (which most do).\n**How often will new CPE courses be added to the Partner Academy?**\nWe aim to continuously expand our CPE offerings. New courses will be announced in the Partner Academy and via our Partner Newsletter. If there’s a topic you’d like to see covered, [let us know](https://app.ramp.com/support/get-help)!\n**What if I experience issues with my CPE certificate or credit eligibility?**\nIf you believe there’s been an error in your course completion or certificate issuance, please [contact us here](https://app.ramp.com/support/get-help). Include your course name, completion date, and account email to help us resolve it quickly.\nWas this article helpful?\nYesNo\nWe're sorry to hear that.\n[Please share your feedback on this article here](https://a.sprig.com/cGsyNm9lVWhPeX5zaWQ6YmIzYzkwODMtNzYyNy00MWZiLTlmM2ItMWMzY2Y2YjlmYzU0?articleID=/hc/en-us/articles/44963024684051-Ramp-Partner-Academy-Overview-and-FAQs&userID=&userName=&userRole=)\nStill need help?

If no match is found, Ramp will then search the transactions of the user(s) the Assistant is assigned to.\n### What notifications will the Assistant receive?\nAssistants will receive their assigned user's action items (such as missing business items) along with their action items in the weekly digest.\nThe assigned user/executive may set filters to automatically forward emails (receipts/memos/coding) to their Assistant. For example, setting the Gmail filters:\n`from: ` `[communications@ramp.com](mailto:communications@ramp.com)`\n`subject contains \"missing\"`\n`auto-forward: assistant email`\n### What can the Assistant user see?\nThe Assistant can see the transactions and related information for the user(s) who have assigned them as Assistant.\nAssistants are **not** able to see activity beyond their designated scope, such as card numbers and the transactions of other users that the user(s) they're assisting can see, even if they are assigned to an Admin user.\nAssistants will also be notified of their manager's missing items in their weekly \"Missing Items\" email.\n### Who can assign themselves an Assistant?\nAny user can assign one or more Assistant users to their Ramp account. One user can have multiple Assistants. Admins can assign any user as an Assistant to any other user on Ramp.\n### Who can be an Assistant?\nAny user can be granted Assistant permissions.

It can function in two ways:\n1. **Recommendations only** – Reviews expenses and shows if they are in or out of policy, citing the relevant text. Reviewers make the final decision.\n![](https://support.ramp.com/hc/article_attachments/44077966195987)\n2. **Approvals + escalations** – Approves in-policy expenses automatically and escalates only uncertain ones to reviewers.\n![](https://support.ramp.com/hc/article_attachments/44077947197587)\n### **How does the Policy agent determine compliance?**\nThe agent evaluates expenses using three inputs:\n1. **Your policy**\n2. **Merchant data (L1–L3)** – e.g., merchant name, transaction date, item names, sales tax\n3. **Employee inputs** – e.g., receipt OCR, trip details, location\nThe agent approves expenses that clearly meet requirements and escalates when context is missing or a violation is detected. Admins can set thresholds and workflows to determine when the agent approves vs. escalates.\n### **How accurate is the Policy agent?**\nEarly customers have reduced manual reviews by ~85% with **99%+ accuracy**."

If you’re a business admin or owner and have questions about setup, please [book time](https://app.ramp.com/meeting-request?product=RAMP_PLUS&from_email=sunset-policy-agent-waitlist) with your Account Manager.\n### **How do I set up an AI-friendly policy?**\nGo to the Policy tab in Ramp and you’ll see a pop-up to set up the agent with a couple options. Note that the agents won’t begin reviewing expenses until your policy is published.\n- **No existing policy?** Use Ramp’s customizable best-practice template.\n- **Already have a policy?** Ramp automatically converts it into Ramp’s structure.\nYour expense policy is always editable and followed by the agent when making decisions. Review carefully before publishing to ensure clarity.\n![](https://support.ramp.com/hc/article_attachments/44077947206803)\n### **What about specific policy exceptions (e.g., CEO exceptions)?**\nExceptions can be added:\n- Directly into your policy text\n- Or in hidden notes within the template (visible only to admins)\nThe agent references both when reviewing expenses.\n### **How does the Policy agent work with my Ramp settings and policy flags?**\n- **Your existing Ramp settings** (spend requests, expense requirements, reviews, travel) override any conflicting written policy rules.\n- **Policy flags** still function and override the agent if there’s a conflict. Use them sparingly since many can now be expressed in your policy.\n**Recommendation:**\n- Disable category-based flags (e.g., alcohol, cigarettes, weekend spend, gifts).\n- Keep receipt-related flags (e.g., duplicate receipt, AI-generated receipt, itemized receipt).\n### **What happens once I publish my policy?**\n- Within ~24 hours, the agent backfills recent expenses and generates recommendations.\n- On your Home Page, you  will see expenses grouped either as **Approval recommended** or **Review recommended**.\n- No auto-approvals occur until the agent is added into approval workflows.\nYou can edit your policy anytime in the Policy tab. Changes only apply to future expenses.\n### **How can I enable the agent to approve in-policy expenses?**\nBy default, the agent only provides recommendations after you publish your policy. To enable approvals:\n1. Go to **Policy > Expense Reviews**.\n2. Add the agent into your existing approval workflows (the steps Ramp follows to decide who needs to review a transaction and when)\n3. Configure conditions, for the agent to approve:\n   - Expenses under a certain amount (e.g., <$1,000).\n   - Expenses for a specific spend program, department, entity, or merchant.\n   - Or replace the entire workflow so humans only review out-of-policy or uncertain expenses.\n### **![](https://support.ramp.com/hc/article_attachments/44077966205715)**\n### **Is there a separate employee-facing policy?**\nYes. In the **Policy** tab, there are two distinct versions of your policy documents:\n- **Policy agent document (admin-facing):** This is where you configure, edit, and update your company’s policy rules for the agent. You can use Ramp’s best-practice templates or upload your existing policy through the merge functionality when you set the agent up. This ensures the policy is structured in a way the agent can easily interpret.\n- **Employee-facing policy document:** This is the version employees see. It remains separate and unchanged when you update the agent document, so employees always have access to a clean, consistent view of the policy."

Once an assistant is assigned, they can book travel in **Assistant Mode**, where the traveler’s details and preferences are auto-filled. This removes the need for back-and-forth communication to gather traveler information and ensures policies are consistently followed.\n> **Watch a walkthrough video of the Travel Delegate Booking feature [here](https://www.loom.com/share/4e19cd12168a4a06a26fe79cf6335e83?sid=d14e661a-3a0d-48b5-bce7-a7ef6a88695b).**"

Funds assigned to the assistant won’t show up here.\n4. **Confirmation and Notifications**\nUpon booking confirmation, both the assistant and the traveler will receive email notifications. The traveler receives the original email, and the assistant is CC’d. Follow-up emails from airlines or Priceline are sent only to the traveler.\n5. **Managing Multiple Travelers**\nAssistants can toggle between profiles at the top to manage multiple travelers and make bookings for each as needed."
