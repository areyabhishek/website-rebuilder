We felt cared for both by Felicia and by the effort she put into this course and would recommend it to any parents‑to‑be who want to be empowered by knowledge and finish the course with a sense of excitement and the ability to make their birth story their own. This course is for every parent who wants to feel well equipped and prepared for their birth journey.❞\n– Cameron and Bing, May 2020"

Felicia works with a team of highly experienced assistant educators, doulas and assistants during BABE classes.\n[![Felicia Roche](https://bayareabirtheducation.com/wp-content/uploads/felicia_roche-1.jpg)](http://feliciaroche.com/)\n### [Felicia Roche](http://feliciaroche.com/)\n##### DONA Certified Doula\n##### DONA Approved Doula Trainer\n##### Lamaze Certified Childbirth Educator\n![Lamaze Certified Childbirth Educator](https://bayareabirtheducation.com/wp-content/uploads/LCCE_purple.png)\nFelicia is a Certified Doula through [DONA](http://www.dona.org/) International since 1998. She has been offering DONA Approved Birth Doula Trainings since 2002 and has trained hundreds of women in this time – women travel from all over the world to take her trainings. She served as the DONA Northern California Representative for 7 years.\nIn June 2006 she became certified with Lamaze International as a Childbirth Educator (LCCE)\nFelicia has assisted over 1000 families during their labors and births in the Bay Area and continues to make a difference for women and families on nearly a weekly basis. She has successfully built strong professional alliances with many care providers and nurses at local hospitals. She is very involved in many aspects of building a doula community locally and nationally.\nIn 2004, the [Learning Annex](http://www.learningannex.com/) in San Francisco contracted Felicia to teach a course titled “How to Start a Career as a Birth Doula.” The course was so successful that in the spring of 2005 Felicia presented the same topic for the Learning Annex in Sacramento.\nShe previously served as the executive director and publications coordinator for [Birthways](http://www.birthways.org/), a non-profit childbirth and pregnancy resources and referral center in the Bay Area.\nBefore finding her calling as a doula Felicia served for many years as a rape crisis counselor, joining women in trauma and guiding them through a heightened and volatile process. She was also a sex educator and lifeskills coach for Planned Parenthood, working with inner-city school kids\n![Gillian Gillette](https://bayareabirtheducation.com/wp-content/uploads/kim.jpg)\n### Kim Knapp\nHi! I’m Kim, I’m a birth doula and childbirth educator.\nI was trained through DONA and had the privilege to be part of the UCSF doula program where I participated in countless unique birth settings. I am a lifelong learner, and I am both honored and grateful to have worked alongside many other amazing birth workers throughout my career. We are each passionate about supporting and advocating for birthing families.\nAs a young birthing person, I personally experienced a traumatic birthing event. Buckled with my own lack of knowledge, my inexperience, the lack of care from the medical staff and my inability to speak up, I was left with years of post-traumatic distress.  It was then I knew I would somehow find my way to birthwork and supporting families to have positive birth experiences.\nLet’s demystify the birth process together.  When you know what to expect, you can plan for how you will approach the difficult parts and celebrate your milestone wins! Knowledge is power.  Educating and empowering yourself to have agency over your decisions transforms fear into confidence.  Confidence makes you unstoppable!\nWhen I am not teaching, coaching, or supporting birth families, I love movies, traveling and making memories with my family.\nLooking forward to meeting you!\n[Page load link](https://bayareabirtheducation.com/about/#)\n[![](https://feliciaroche.com/wp-content/uploads/Logo_Wellness_Magazine.png)](https://wellnessmasterclub.ewellnessmag.com/birthing-brilliance-how-felicia-roche-and-bay-area-birth-education-are-changing-the-narrative-for-modern-families-ffs-a-699-2025-bay-area-birth-education/)\n[See Felicia featured in Wellness Magazine](https://wellnessmasterclub.ewellnessmag.com/birthing-brilliance-how-felicia-roche-and-bay-area-birth-education-are-changing-the-narrative-for-modern-families-ffs-a-699-2025-bay-area-birth-education/)\n**X**\n[Go to Top](https://bayareabirtheducation.com/about/#)"

And they skip out on a lot of parts, but the Babe class filled us in on all those parts!\nThe way Felicia and her team educate about labor, delivery and the first few weeks postpartum helped build our confidence. There are lots of little bits of wisdom with catchy phrases that we started calling Felicia-isms. They were easy to remember even when our brains were elsewhere and we were severely sleep deprived, but they helped keep us calm and confident that we could do this!\nHighly recommend the Babe class to anyone who is preparing to give birth and there’s so much great content to educate partners on how to be supportive.”\n### What you will get from your BABE class\n- How to know if this is it!  Timing contractions and signs of labor\n- Signs of labor and timing contractions\n- Relaxation and coping strategies – Positions, Breathing, Massage\n- Understanding of medical treatments – When and how they can be beneficial and possible side effects\n- Pain medications for labor and birth – shared in a respectful, objective way\n- The role of the doula\n- The role of the partner/dad/co-parent – How they can help and how they need help, too\n- Breastfeeding tips\n- Soothing your newborn\n- Maximizing your recovery after birth\n- Infant CPR basics\n- An engaging and memorable experience!"
