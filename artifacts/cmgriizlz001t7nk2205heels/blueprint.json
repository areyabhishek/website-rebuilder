Payment can be made via bank transfer or at any convenience store.\nBy completing an identification verification process (“Know Your Customer” or KYC process), users can also get access to Paidy Plus, and get upgraded benefits like zero-interest installments and Paidy Link, which allows Paidy to be used as a payment method at merchants that accept Visa."

When users are verified, it helps Paidy to more accurately assess the credit status of each user, which enables the company to better manage credit risk.\nPaidy is also constantly looking to introduce new features and services to its users, and this means that they are faced with the need to analyze data from multiple sources, which includes front-end data from their website and app, as well as third-party data from their partners.\nWhile they were able to analyze the backend data and track financial metrics, the team knew that the ability to answer questions about [conversions](https://mixpanel.com/solutions/convert/) and drop off is critical to the long-term growth of the business."

          "content": "The Paidy team found Mixpanel and decided to leverage product analytics to answer their pressing user flow and conversion questions. While they started with a simple use case for the front-end design team, Mixpanel is now a key part of how Paidy gets insights into key user flows like the KYC process.\n“The KYC flow is simple. We explain the KYC process, then users take photos of their documents and IDs which get uploaded onto Paidy. The users are then asked to confirm if they’re politically exposed individuals or not before submitting their application. We then review the information and approve or reject the application”, explained Rafal Rawicki, Platform Architect at Paidy.\nBy using the Funnels reports in Mixpanel, the Paidy team easily identifies areas of friction and takes action to optimize the process. “This gives us visibility into what needs to be changed. For example, we noticed that around 3% of users would mistakenly mark themselves as politically exposed, and this would cause their applications to be rejected. There are many additional services that have the completion of the KYC process as a requirement so getting more users to complete this flow is important to our ability to upsell,” said Rafal.\nThey also made an interesting discovery that a large drop-off occurred when users are presented with the list of documents that they can use in the KYC process. “Our hypothesis is we have users who are interested in completing the process, but they don’t have their documents at hand and we should remind them about the document submission at a different time of the day”, said Rafal.\nThis discovery inspired improvements to the design and onboarding process, including the inclusion of new push notifications for users who dropped from the funnel.\n![The old KYC flow (left) assumed that users would upload their verification documents immediately while the new flow (right) accounts for the possibility that users did not have their documents with them and might wish to complete the process later. image](https://mxpnlcms.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PaidyScreenshot.png)\nThe old KYC flow (left) assumed that users would upload their verification documents immediately while the new flow (right) accounts for the possibility that users did not have their documents with them and might wish to complete the process later.\nToday, Paidy utilizes Mixpanel to analyze the conversions for most of their user flows and the changes in their metrics are also used to help them identify whether users are able to successfully navigate through the product or if something is broken.\nThe use of the platform has also expanded from the front-end design team to the marketing team and their analysts.\nThe Paidy team also looked at adoption and usage of new features like their Shopping and Inspiration tabs, including the search keywords and what users do after searching. The actions taken after searching are used to understand if the search result helped users to find what they were looking for.\n![Understanding the top search keywords helps the paid team to better understand what products users were interested in, and the analysis of the actions taken after the search indicates whether they found the search results satisfying.  image](https://mxpnlcms.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/paidygraph_blur.png)\nUnderstanding the top search keywords helps the paid team to better understand what products users were interested in, and the analysis of the actions taken after the search indicates whether they found the search results satisfying.\n### Leveraging integrations for better insights\nAs Paidy continues to increase the variety of its offerings, Rafal sees a need to integrate all its tools, including Mixpanel, into a wider data stack.\n“Data is critical for us to be able to make choices and also know when we need to make improvements in our business. This is something that everyone in Paidy understands. With our increasing list of services comes increased needs, and an increased number of data sources. So, we want to make sure everything in our tech stack integrates well with each other,” shared Rafal.\nAs a key component of the stack, Mixpanel is integrated with [OneSignal](https://mixpanel.com/partners/onesignal-integration/) (push notifications) and [Appsflyer](https://mixpanel.com/partners/appsflyer/) (mobile attribution) to help drive better and more complete customer insights for Paidy.\n“We are continuously making improvements to how tools within our stack integrate with each other and have plans to integrate more data sources as we evolve,” said Rafal.\nPaidy also continues to look at expanding their use of Mixpanel, including tracking the impact of product changes and enabling alerts for their team when metrics are trending in the wrong direction.\n### Words of advice\nAs the key owner of Paidy’s overall data and analytics stack, data governance, and product feature requirements, Rafal has this piece of advice to share, “We’ve learnt that it’s important to start with data from day one. Putting metrics in place from day one can be very useful. It may seem easy to scope and implement metrics later but not having them from the start makes it really hard to drive decisions and motivate stakeholders when it matters the most.”\nMixpanel makes it easy for teams to explore and understand their data. No delays. No SQL.\n[Get Demo](https://mixpanel.com/contact-us/demo-request) [Get Started Free](https://mixpanel.com/register)\nRelated customer stories\n[Insurance\\\\\n\\\\\n![Logo](https://mxpnlcms.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/lemonade-logo-purple.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nInsuring the best user experience](https://mixpanel.com/customers/lemonade-drives-growth-mixpanels-user-insights) [Financial Services\\\\\n\\\\\n![Logo](https://mxpnlcms.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/betterment-logo-purple.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nUncovering critical insights into user journeys](https://mixpanel.com/customers/betterment-optimizes-customer-experience) [Financial Services\\\\\n\\\\\n![Logo](https://mxpnlcms.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/brightside-logo-purple.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nProving quick wins for an online banking app](https://mixpanel.com/customers/brightside-increases-account-opens-by-30-in-less-than-six-months-with-mixpanel)\n[Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com/home)\nProgress is possible\n[Get Demo](https://mixpanel.com/contact-us/demo-request)\nPlatform\n[Product Analytics](https://mixpanel.com/platform/product-analytics) [Web Analytics](https://mixpanel.com/platform/web-analytics) [Mobile Analytics](https://mixpanel.com/platform/mobile-analytics) [Metric Trees](https://mixpanel.com/metric-trees) [Warehouse Connectors](https://mixpanel.com/releases/data-warehouse-connectors) [Session Replay](https://mixpanel.com/releases/session-replay) [Integrations](https://mixpanel.com/partners/integrations) [Security & Privacy](https://mixpanel.com/security-privacy)\n[Pricing](https://mixpanel.com/pricing)\nUse Cases\n[Acquire New Users](https://mixpanel.com/use-cases/acquire) [Engage Your Users](https://mixpanel.com/use-cases/engage) [Grow Your Usership](https://mixpanel.com/use-cases/grow) [Empower Your Teams](https://mixpanel.com/use-cases/empower)\nTeams\n[Product](https://mixpanel.com/teams/product-teams) [Data Analysts](https://mixpanel.com/teams/data-teams) [Marketing](https://mixpanel.com/teams/marketing-teams) [Engineering](https://mixpanel.com/teams/engineering-teams)\nIndustries\n[Finance](https://mixpanel.com/industries/finance-analytics) [Media & Entertainment](https://mixpanel.com/industries/media-and-entertainment-analytics) [B2B](https://mixpanel.com/industries/b2b-saas-analytics) [Ecommerce](https://mixpanel.com/industries/ecommerce-analytics) [Healthcare](https://mixpanel.com/industries/healthcare-analytics) [AI](https://mixpanel.com/industries/ai-analytics)\nBusiness Size\n[Enterprise](https://mixpanel.com/enterprise) [Small & Midsize](https://mixpanel.com/smb) [Startup Program](https://mixpanel.com/startups)\nResources\n[Docs & Guides](https://docs.mixpanel.com/) [Contact Support](https://mixpanel.com/contact-us/support) [What's New](https://docs.mixpanel.com/changelogs) [Troubleshooting FAQs](https://docs.mixpanel.com/troubleshooting/faqs) [Blog](https://mixpanel.com/blog) [Events & Webinars](https://events.mixpanel.com/) [Community](https://community.mixpanel.com/) [Customer Stories](https://mixpanel.com/customers)\nCompany\n[About Us](https://mixpanel.com/about) [Become a Partner](https://mixpanel.com/partners) [Expert Directory](https://mixpanel.com/partners/experts) [Careers](https://mixpanel.com/jobs) [Contact Sales](https://mixpanel.com/contact-us/sales)\nTemplates\n[Company KPIs](https://mixpanel.com/p/QLBHa24vdYuK2MJLiNUA1S) [Feature Launch](https://mixpanel.com/p/5dbqyToAtFMaDJVJNzUeuG) [Lifecycle Cohort Analysis](https://mixpanel.com/p/CEngFwLvPa5zvTSLvFTHNH) [Ecommerce](https://mixpanel.com/p/2cv24kB3k5n9reXr9bSJKU) [Marketing KPIs](https://mixpanel.com/p/MKDgQSoYBZciN4AGgY7Mgh) [Web Analytics](https://mixpanel.com/p/BkaDwovdEpEcMJp33R6sah) [AI Company KPIs](https://mixpanel.com/p/NaKPyubj6EuA4oV75taqrq)\nCompare Us\n[Amplitude](https://mixpanel.com/compare/amplitude) [Heap](https://mixpanel.com/compare/heap) [Pendo](https://mixpanel.com/compare/pendo) [Google Analytics](https://mixpanel.com/compare/google-analytics) [PostHog](https://mixpanel.com/compare/posthog) [Fullstory](https://mixpanel.com/compare/fullstory) [Adobe Analytics](https://mixpanel.com/compare/adobe)\nPrefers reduced motion\n©2024 Mixpanel.

based on their behaviors—including purchasing patterns, product usage, engagement levels, and interaction with a brand—to later target them with specific experiences.\nUnlike demographic or geographic segmentation, behavioral segmentation focuses on what customers _do_ rather than who they _are_. This gives deep insights into their needs, preferences, and decision-making processes, empowering you to build campaigns and drive targeted messages that motivate specific actions.\nImagine walking into your favorite restaurant. The waitress greets you by name and walks you to your favorite table by the window. Without asking, she brings you your Diet Coke over ice with a lemon wedge and mentions that the daily special is vegan today since she knows your dietary restrictions. This experience is likely to feel seamless and delightful because someone has been observing your _past_ _behavior_ to give you the best possible experience.\nIn the digital world, **behavioral segmentation** allows businesses to create tailored experiences by first understanding how groups of their customers interact with their websites and applications.\nThe more advanced you are at [segmenting your users](https://mixpanel.com/blog/user-segmentation-guide-understanding-customers-2/), the more you can customize your approach for each group, and the more you can drive the success metrics that matter most for your business. You can optimize your messages and user journeys for each group to keep them engaged and satisfied. And when you can gain deep insight about the behaviors of your most valuable users, it’s easier to attract more users just like them.\nGrouping users by their behaviors is the clearest way to understand the value they’re getting from your product, as well as any friction they face. Any digital action can be tracked and counted as a behavior. A media site may consider every click, refresh, and share to be valuable data. A SaaS company, on the other hand, is more likely to be interested in conversions on marketing campaigns and the paths users take through their app (known as a user journey).\nProduct and marketing teams use behavioral segmentation to identify their most valuable groups, such as repeat visitors, [power users](https://mixpanel.com/blog/power-users/), or high spenders. Once this group is defined, you can learn which features, factors, and content correlate with higher engagement among these groups. This surfaces new ideas for attracting more of these users and [drives higher retention](https://mixpanel.com/blog/what-is-customer-retention/) amongst your user base.\nFor example, a fitness app might find that users who share their workouts with friends work out more frequently than the average user. You could then A/B test whether nudging users to invite friends to work out together leads them to track workouts in the app more often.\nBehavioral data allows product, analytics, marketing, and customer service teams to:\nUnderstand why users aren’t converting\nBy tracking your users’ actions at every step of the funnel, you can see which behavioral segments aren’t converting and why. By identifying high- and low-performing user segments, you can optimize your product to encourage the desired behavior, leading to higher conversions overall.\nFocus on products and features that matter\nWhen you figure out the most popular products and features among your users, you can prioritize where your team should spend their time. Ultimately, you want to keep your most valuable customers happy. By understanding their favorite features, you can continue to invest, develop, or improve products with these users clearly in mind.\nCreate a better user experience\nBehavioral segmentation helps product teams improve UX because it allows you to identify key spots where users drop off, then troubleshoot these places in the user journey. For example, the team Kaplan Test Prep used Mixpanel user analytics to test a hypothesis—that adding a sign-on option for new users who downloaded their app would increase user numbers. The change confirmed the team’s theory and improved their [conversion rates by 40 percent](https://mixpanel.com/blog/kaplan-test-prep-increased-conversions-with-mixpanel/)."

          "content": "There’s a wide variety of user behaviors you can use to segment your marketing and product experience. Here’s a breakdown of the most common types.\nPurchase behavior segmentation\nPurchase behavior segmentation divides customers into groups based on their buying habits and purchase histories. This can include grouping based on data of who has made a purchase before, who has made repeat purchases, or who has put items in a cart they abandoned.\nThis data allows marketers to create more targeted and effective campaigns. For example, if you’re an ecommerce company selling luxury apparel, you might want to create a segment of customers who purchased swimwear last summer and email them offering a discount to purchase similar merchandise this summer.\nUsage behavior segmentation\nUsage behavior segmentation means grouping customers based on their usage habits in an application. For example, if you discover a segment of your customer base that is very active on your desktop application but not on mobile, you could target them with in-app promotions of your mobile app to deepen usage and expand the value they’re getting from your product.\nOccasion-based segmentation\nOccasion-based segmentation involves targeting customers when they complete specific actions. Occasions can include signing up for an app, making purchases, or adopting certain features. For example, a SaaS company that sells marketing technology may decide that customers successfully launching their first campaign is a noteworthy event. The team might then create a segment for customers who’ve hit this milestone and target them with a campaign asking for reviews and testimonials, since after this occasion, customers are likely to feel positive sentiment.\nBenefit-sought segmentation\nBenefit-sought segmentation means grouping customers by the specific benefit they’re hoping to unlock from using your product. For example, an ecommerce beauty brand could use past purchase data to create segments for customers interested in skincare, customers interested in cosmetics, and customers interested in anti-aging products. By delivering tailored marketing campaigns that highlight the value propositions of each, the messages are more likely to resonate and lead to purchases.\nCustomer journey stage segmentation\nCustomer journey stage segmentation is a helpful way for marketers to understand where prospects are in their buying journeys and target them accordingly. For example, if you create a “top of the funnel” segment made up of prospects who’ve read 3-5 pieces of blog content, you could target them with emails or ad campaigns that show case studies or how-to guides that take their education deeper.\nCustomer loyalty segmentation\nCustomer loyalty segmentation is a way to segment customers based on loyalty behaviors, such as making repeat purchases and promoting your brand to others. Many brands reward their most loyal customers with exclusive access to new products or features, discounts, or event invitations. This is an effective way to deepen customer relationships, leading to more customer advocacy, which can drive referrals. Brands can also target less loyal customers with content and offers to encourage deeper engagement and build greater loyalty over time.\nEngagement level segmentation\nEngagement level segmentation groups customers based on the depth of their usage of a product. For example, you may want to create a segment of power users and roll out new features to them first to reward them for their engagement. You could also use this segment to gather valuable feedback from your most highly engaged and knowledgeable users. Similarly, you could create a segment of low-usage customers and target them with educational campaigns that reinforce the value of your product and offer step-by-step tutorials on how to get started."

          "title": "How to get started with behavioral segmentation",
          "content": "Here’s a proven 5-step process to get your first segments up and running:\n### 1\\. Define your objectives\nThe first step in implementing behavioral segmentation is to get clear on your objective. When you’re starting with behavioral segmentation, it’s wise not to get bogged down by tracking too many metrics.\nRather, pick a few key indicators to focus on, ideally ones tied to the topline KPIs you’re responsible for in your role. For example, for many freemium software companies, activity metrics such as website views and clicks can be less important than sign-ups and upgrades to premium features.\nAfter you’ve gotten clear on your goal, ask yourself which user behaviors are most relevant to achieve this goal. For example, if you’re a product manager promoting a freemium app, you may decide that reducing churn is your [North Star metric](https://mixpanel.com/blog/north-star-metric/). User behaviors to track could include monitoring monthly active users and adoption of high-value features that are known to correlate with retention.\n### 2\\. Set up event tracking\nNext, you’ll want to make sure that the behaviors you’ve identified as contributing to your goals are being tracked in your [digital analytics tool](https://mixpanel.com/features/). In Mixpanel, every action that end users take in your app can be tracked as an event. Each event is associated with a time and a user by default and can be set up to track other associated properties as well, depending on your business model and needs. Having clean, consistent data is essential, so it’s well worth investing effort to set things up properly.\n### 3\\. Create your first behavioral segments\nNext, it’s time to build reports in Mixpanel that help you segment users into cohorts based on the behaviors you’ve identified. Navigate to the **Cohorts** tab in the navigation bar, and click on the **Create Cohort** button in the top right of the screen. From here, you can build segments of users who have exhibited the behaviors you’ve identified in step 1. This can look like building a segment of ‘power users’ who log into your app each month or those who regularly use your most high-value features, and another segment of ‘churn risk’ users who aren’t MAUs and don’t use your most powerful features.\nMany companies rely on data scientists and methods like SQL or BI tools to perform [behavioral analytics](https://mixpanel.com/blog/behavioral-analytics-guide/) and build segments, but this can be time-consuming, cumbersome, and require deep technical skills. With a user analytics solution like Mixpanel, you can quickly and easily build segments and take action without any technical know-how.\n### 4\\. Activate your segments\nNow that you’ve created a segment of customers who exhibit a shared behavior, it’s time to target them with specific messaging and offerings to ease the friction they face and provide more value. To continue our above example, this can look like sending marketing emails to inactive users with messaging about the value they’re missing out on, or sending in-app messages to users to point them towards your most high-value features. If your digital analytics platform [integrates with your email marketing and ad platforms](https://mixpanel.com/partners/integrations), you can target this user segment directly with emails and ads based on the behaviors they’ve shown.\n### 5\\. Measure and iterate\nIt’s important to measure the impact of your targeted activities on your segments, based on both the success metrics you established at the outset. Does your marketing email bring more users into the app more regularly? Are churn-risk customers using more of your high-value features?\nAs is often the case with data analytics, each question you answer successfully may lead to more questions to answer to drive the results you’re hoping for. The more you think of this process as a continuous cycle of experimentation and refinement, the more likely you are to see success with behavioral segmentation."

          "content": "### How Lemonade increased conversions 250% with Mixpanel\nThe team at Lemonade, an NYC-headquartered insurance company, noticed that new users weren’t completing their sign-up process. When the team used [Mixpanel’s Funnels](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/reports/funnels), they discovered a sizable drop-off right after new users requested a quote.\n“We tested the placement of features, order of different sections, and even the copy,” explained Gil Sadis, Head of Product at Lemonade. After reconfiguring the sign-up experience, Gil’s team increased the number of people who viewed a quote and then purchased by 250%. (To learn more about their strategy, read [Lemonade](https://mixpanel.com/customers/lemonade-drives-growth-mixpanels-user-insights/)’s full case study.)\n### How DocuSign converted 5% more paid users\nDocuSign, the global e-signature provider, largely owes its success to its viral distribution strategy. That is, the more contracts sent out on the platform, the more new users are exposed to its ease-of-use, and the more new sign-ups they drive. That’s how the company can draw in [130,000 new users every single day](https://mixpanel.com/customers/docusign-accelerates-growth/). Senior Product Manager Drew Ashlock was tasked with scaling the company’s user base even more.\nSince users are accustomed to DocuSign’s generous freemium features, Drew and his product team knew there were numerous opportunities to encourage free users to upgrade as they used DocuSign more. They used Mixpanel’s [Funnels](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/reports/funnels) to track the behaviors of both paying and non-paying users. Then, they got curious about experimenting with which features they offered to each group. When Drew and team offered what were typically paid features to non-paying users, they saw a remarkable [5% lift in conversions and purchases](https://mixpanel.com/customers/docusign-accelerates-growth/)."

          "content": "### What is an example of behavioral segmentation?\nFor example, say the product team at a video streaming platform used a digital analytics platform to visualize their funnel and see where users drop off. Their funnel consists of three ‘events’ or user behaviors: open app, watch video, and make a purchase.\nThe team could then create a segment of users who watched a video, but did not make a purchase and target them with paid ads promoting value of their paid upgrades. This is one way you can use behavioral segmentation to increase app engagement and generate more revenue.\n### What are the 7 types of behavioral segmentation?\nThe seven main types of behavioral segmentation are purchase behavior segmentation, usage behavior segmentation, occasion-based segmentation, benefit-sought segmentation, customer journey stage segmentation, customer loyalty segmentation, and engagement level segmentation. (For a detailed explanation of each, see above!)\n### How is behavioral segmentation different from demographic segmentation?\nWhere demographic segmentation looks at a customer’s characteristics (like their age, gender, income, or geographic location) to divide them into groups, behavioral segmentation groups customers based on the actions they take (e.g., previous purchases made, pages viewed, or CTAs clicked).\n### How do you measure the effectiveness of behavioral segmentation?\nThere are a wide variety of indicators that your behavioral segmentation is effective, depending on what insights you uncover and how you put them into action. If you’re a growth marketer, effective behavioral segmentation might look like better campaigns that yield more clicks, more downloads, or more purchases. If you’re a product manager, this could look like more feature adoption, more monthly active users, and a lower churn rate.\n### What tools are used for behavioral segmentation?\nThere are a wide variety of web and product analytics tools you can use for behavioral segmentation, as well as business intelligence or BI tools.

response to, a user’s engagement with a business, such as page views, email sign-ups, or other important user actions—to segment users according to their behavior. Businesses can use that information to analyze things like engagement, conversion, and retention.\nAsk the top organizations around the world—in any industry—how they build successful products, and you’ll hear some variation of this answer: “We followed the data.”\nWhen we study user behavior, we gather data on what people do—and what they don’t do—so we can build products that people will value. After all, you wouldn’t build a product that no one would use, would you? Nor would you invest time, money, and energy in a feature set that has no observable demand.\nBehavioral analytics is what helps you understand what your users and customers are doing and why, so that you can build better products.\nBehavioral analytics is the process of using behavioral data—or data generated by, or in response to, a user’s engagement with a business, such as page views, email sign-ups, or other important user actions—to construct [behavioral cohorts](https://mixpanel.com/blog/behavioral-segmentation/) and analyze things like engagement, conversion, and retention.\nWhen behavioral analytics is applied to digital product management (often called product analytics) it can take the guesswork out of development and mitigate the risk of every bet you make. Teams use behavioral analytics to determine what users like and don’t like and, by inference, what adjustments will make the product more valuable. Behavioral analytics is also the key to personalization, so that products can deliver the right experience to the right users at the right time.\nIn short, behavioral analytics plays a crucial role in developing best-in-breed products."

          "content": "Behavioral analytics is useful across a wide range of industries and use cases. It can help all kinds of companies understand their customers better and create experiences tailored to them.\n### Ecommerce\nA classic example of using behavioral analytics in ecommerce is targeted advertising.\nLet’s say a potential customer visits a website and views a product, but doesn’t complete the purchase. Marketing teams use that data to automatically create targeted ad campaigns based on the customer's behavior, showing them products they’ve visited. This approach is more personalized and more likely to be successful than a more generic campaign showing a different, unfamiliar product.\n### Finance\nFinancial institutions and fintech companies can also use behavioral analytics for personalized recommendations and targeted ad campaigns. In addition, financial companies monitor anomalous user behavior to help them spot and prevent fraud. Have you ever had to enter extra verification before signing into your banking app from a new device, for example? That’s because the banking app detected unusual user behavior and wants to make sure you’re an authorized user before granting access.\n### Healthcare\nHealthcare companies can use behavioral analytics to improve their patient experience. For example, healthcare companies can use reports like [Funnels](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/reports/funnels) and [Group Analytics](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/data-structure/group-analytics) to help speed up patient wait times or analyze clinic-level data to improve efficiency.\n[_Watch our video_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdvLuC4Iyjo) _to learn more about user behavior analytics for healthcare._\n### Product development\nBehavioral analytics and [understanding your users](https://mixpanel.com/blog/behavioral-segmentation/) are the key to successful product development. PMs use behavioral analytics to determine which features to prioritize and which user cohorts drive the most value.\nLet’s say you want to nudge more users to convert from unpaid subscribers to paid ones. You segment your users to compare both categories, and you notice that paid users are more likely to have shared a specific behavior—completing onboarding, for example. This leads you to hypothesize that users who complete onboarding get more value from your product, and are therefore more likely to be willing to pay for it. You can test this hypothesis by pushing more users to complete onboarding and see how that affects conversion rates."

          "content": "Unlike other types of [business analytics](https://mixpanel.com/blog/business-intelligence-vs-business-analytics/), behavioral analytics combines two technologies: User segmentation and behavioral or event tracking.\nWhile some analytics vendors offer only one or the other—user (object) data or behavioral (event) data—behavioral analytics ties users to the events they trigger, thus producing a map of their actions as a flow or customer journey.\nViewed either alone or in aggregate, user journeys tell stories that teams can use to tweak and improve their product development, marketing, and launch strategies.\n_Read: [The difference between BI and product analytics—and why you need both](https://mixpanel.com/blog/the-difference-between-product-analytics-and-bi-tools-and-why-you-need-both/)_"

          "content": "Behavioral analytics combines data from different sources to map how users interact with your product. A complete behavioral analytics tool will combine and analyze website, product, mobile, CRM, and customer support data.\nCombining data from multiple sources can be tricky without the right platform, and anyone combining data manually should be aware of possible duplicates or errors. Solutions like Mixpanel offer [Warehouse Connectors](https://mixpanel.com/releases/data-warehouse-connectors/), which sync and mirror data from your data warehouse so that anyone on the team can perform data analysis without dirtying the data.\nBy combining all of this behavioral data into a single platform, PMs can see how different actions across the company impact each other, and answer more complex questions, such as:\nWhich acquisition channels had the highest ROAS?\nDid shipping this feature decrease (or increase) support tickets?\nWhich marketing campaigns brought in users who continue using the product after a month?\nWhat percentage of our Enterprise revenue uses the features we shipped last year?\nWhich account demographics have the best retention?\nThese kinds of complex insights are only accessible when you have a full view of user behavior."

          "title": "The importance of user properties and event properties",
          "content": "Behavioral data can, and should, always be tied back to a single end-user, but good behavioral analytics typically involves separating “user properties” from “event properties”. Both are very important to analyze because they tell you who your users are and what they’re doing.\nUser properties are anything around user traits that reflect the state of the user and apply across all their events, including:\nUnique vs non-unique\nActive vs inactive\nNew or not new\nThere are also several custom properties you can analyze, depending on the type of app or product you have. In a gaming app, for example, your custom user properties may include an amount of in-game currency and current game level.\nEvent properties involve any action a user takes in your product, which could be anything from making a payment to finishing a level to clicking a button. Event properties show you how your users are engaging with your app and will, of course, vary depending on the type of app you have and the specific information you think is required for understanding a particular event.\nHow can you benefit from behavioral analytics?\nWhether you sell socks, streaming video, or a B2B SaaS product—if you want to grow, you need to do (at least) two things really well:\n[Acquire new users](https://mixpanel.com/use-cases/acquire/)\n[Retain those users](https://mixpanel.com/blog/what-is-customer-retention/)\nIf a company wants to personalize its service to users—thus increasing the likelihood of acquisition and retention—it needs users’ behavior data.\nFor example, a streaming movie platform can’t know that a user loves horror films simply based on demographic information like their age, gender, or nationality. If they try to recommend horror films to everyone who fits a certain demographic, they’ll end up alienating a large percentage of their users. But if they look at behavioral data and only recommend horror movies to users who have watched horror movies in the past, they’re much more likely to find an interested audience. The key to that kind of targeting is seeing, analyzing, and understanding the signals a user sends with their behavior.\nBehavioral analytics provides user-level data, so teams can answer questions like:\nWhat do users click within the product?\nWhere do users get stuck?\nHow do users react to feature changes?\nHow long do users take from first click to conversion?\nHow do users react to marketing messages?\nWhich ads are the most effective?\nHow can we nudge users to be more successful in what they’re trying to accomplish?\nConducting behavioral analysis is more complicated than simply running reports in an analytics tool. Teams must first identify what they want to achieve and write down the paths they expect users to take. Only with preset expectations can teams identify whether users are deviating from the ideal path and then redirect them.\nHere’s an example of what that can look like:\nThe tech-driven insurance provider Lemonade adjusted its user paths to increase revenue. The goal was to convert more website and app visitors into paying customers. With Mixpanel analytics, they noticed a “staggering drop-off” in user flow right before the point of purchase. By analyzing the page where the drop-off occurred, the team realized it was due to a technical error and a weak call-to-action (CTA). They fixed the bug and reworded the CTA, which led to a 50 percent increase in the number of users who purchased additional coverage.\n_Read: [How Lemonade achieved 6x growth](https://mixpanel.com/customers/lemonade-drives-growth-mixpanels-user-insights/)_"

          "title": "Steps for successful behavioral analysis",
          "content": "Embedding behavioral analytics into your organization’s culture can seem daunting—it involves a lot of decisions (big and small), followed by many tweaks and optimizations. As with most things, a “one-size-fits-all” approach isn’t going to work.\nSome of the work involved is technical (wrangling data, implementing a tracker), while other tasks are strategic (goal setting, building a tracking plan), and still others are analytical (building and interpreting reports). There’s plenty of overlap, and achieving success requires tight collaboration between teams and departments.\nWhether you’re starting from zero or already have a fully-fledged behavioral analytics stack in place, here are the high-level steps for kicking off any behavioral analytics project:\n### 1\\. Select goals, KPIs, and metrics\nTo determine whether users are reaching the right goals (e.g., purchase or conversion), select the KPIs and metrics that indicate progress toward those goals.\nExamples:\nA fitness app that makes money through monthly subscriptions tracks paid subscriber growth.\nAn enterprise resource planning (ERP) software that relies on annual contracts tracks users who complete the onboarding sequence.\nNote that behavioral analytics goals might be a bit different than you’re used to; we tend to conflate goals and results, and it’s much better to start from a goal centered on measurement rather than a goal centered on a particular result.\n![Article image](https://thesignalprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Goals-Metrics-image-1024x576-1-768x432.png)\nFor example, “Increase sign-up conversion from 5% to 10%” is a wonderful goal in general—but it’s not an analytics goal. It’s a result.\nWhy? Because measuring something is not the same as changing it. The macro goal of any behavioral analytics project is to accurately capture behaviors, so we can analyze those behaviors and then make informed decisions about what we may change to make an impact.\nA revised version of this goal might be: “Track all user journeys from Landing to Sign Up and find the best/worst conversion paths.” The revised version is a better goal because it focuses on measurement rather than a result.\n### 2\\. Map out the critical paths\nCritical paths are the series of events that need to occur or actions your users need to take for your product to be successful.\nTo determine your critical paths, ask, “What are the most common paths for users to reach their goals based on this service or app’s design?” If the product [has already been launched](https://mixpanel.com/blog/2018/06/05/product-launch-metrics/), you can use actual user data to answer this question. If the product is pre-launch, use wireframes of the suspected or intended flow.\nCritical path examples:\nAn ecommerce website tracks a user from their first page visit to adding an item to their shopping cart to checkout because that flow leads to purchases.\nA streaming music app can track users as they move from its homepage to playing a song.\n### 3\\. Create a tracking plan\nBased on the user flow, decide which events you need to track. Tracking everything is a mistake—too much data clutters the analytics and makes useful information harder to find.\nSome events contain multiple properties. For example, the event for playing a song within a music app could contain properties for the song title, genre, and artist.\nTo keep events and properties organized, companies typically [create a tracking plan](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/tracking-best-practices/tracking-plan). This directory of all events serves as a map for implementing the analytics tool (see Step 5, below). A tracking plan should be revised and updated as the product, team, and goals change.\n(To reduce the burden of trying to share and control access to the tracking plan, Mixpanel’s [Lexicon](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/data-governance/lexicon) stores the event name taxonomy for all to see.)\nInvolve all teams—analytics, product, marketing, and engineering—in drafting the tracking plan. They’ll all need to understand how the users and events are named and organized if they’re going to run reports and understand the results.\nOf course, getting started with your analytics is often more important than fleshing out a robust tracking plan on day one. Opting for an auto-tracking solution at first is a great fit for many teams and organizations. Just make sure you're you're using a flexible option like [Mixpanel Autocapture](https://mixpanel.com/blog/introducing-mixpanel-autocapture-event-tracking/) that allows precision tracking to be added on as you grow your analytics and better understand what's most important to track.\n### 4\\. Use unique identifiers to understand behavior across platforms\nMost digital products today exist across multiple platforms, which makes it difficult to track unique users and understand their behavior across these platforms. One user can appear to be multiple people unless assigned a unique identifier—either an email or a string of characters—that persists across platforms and devices and connects the touchpoints along their journey.\nTeams should ensure their behavioral analytics platform vendor provides a unique identifier that won’t change over time so that they can track and understand their behavior across platforms.\n### 5\\. Implement analytics and begin event tracking\nOnce the tracking plan is complete, you can deploy behavioral data analytics software and use its SDK or API to integrate it with your products. Assign a unique identifier for users and set up user and event properties as outlined in the tracking plan.\nSometimes you’ll discover additional events you want to track during implementation. This isn’t an issue as long as you update both the tracking plan and the analytics service.\nBefore the tracking system goes live, use test devices to verify that the event and user tracking is firing properly. Mixpanel’s [schemas API](https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/lexicon-schemas-api) and [data audit](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028823552-Data-Audit) features can help streamline this process.\nWhen all your tests pass, you’re ready to start collecting real data and analyzing users."

          "content": "Behavioral data is primarily used for product management. The ability to apply the results of behavioral analytics—using data to build better products while mitigating the risk of trying something new—is the return on your investment.\nTo apply the results of behavioral analytics, start with a hypothesis, use several different metrics to validate it, and then (through deduction and exploration) construct a KPI based on what you’ve learned. Only then are you ready to experiment with new features, test them on key cohorts of customers, and finally declare (with confidence) that you are building a better product.\nThis process is designed to be repeated. And as you repeat this cycle, you successfully iterate on your product’s development with a statistically-driven guarantee that the investments you’ve made are the right ones.\n### Segmentation\nMost teams use [segmentation](https://mixpanel.com/blog/2018/05/09/user-segmentation-guide-understanding-customers/) to join users' characteristics and behaviors. An e-commerce app, for example, could create a segment for recent users who abandoned items in a shopping cart, or filter for power shoppers who access the app multiple times a week.\nSegmentation helps teams build more complete customer profiles and create [cohorts](https://mixpanel.com/blog/cohort-analysis/) (defined segments of users based on common important characteristics or experiences). Armed with this information, they can adjust their product and marketing to better address the specific needs of each segment or of the business.\n![Article image](https://thesignalprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/blog-post-image-segmentation-1024x883-1-768x662.png)\n_[Watch our video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_SKV3080yg) to learn more about behavioral segmentation._\n### Funnels\nTo track users’ progress toward outcomes such as purchases or signups, many teams use [funnel reports](https://mixpanel.com/blog/introduction-to-analytics-funnel-analysis/). Funnels display a series of stages in a user journey, as well as how many users progress from one stage to the next—for example, from download to signup and purchase. If one stage has a low conversion rate, it’s a signal that that stage needs attention.\nFunnel data lets teams A/B test different buttons, messages, and images to see if small changes improve conversions. Funnel data can also be used to personalize parts of an app or website, say, to greet returning users, or present prospects with content relevant to their industry.\n![Article image](https://thesignalprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/mixpanel.com_report_2138137_view_290551_funnels_-1-1024x932-1-768x699.png)\n_[Watch our video on Mixpanel Funnels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyDmLtb9zaU) to learn more._\nTeams can also use funnel data to deduce which behaviors are correlated with high retention. Your retention rate shows you an average across all users. By digging into behavioral and demographic trends beneath the metric, or by looking at specific cohorts, you can identify which users are likely to become loyal customers.\nA media site, for instance, could look at the cohort of users that continue to return to the site eight weeks after signup to see if they share certain behaviors, such as a propensity to leave comments.\nWith a clear view of what’s happening within the product, teams can run experiments and make alterations to improve the product and help users find more value.\nThis is what “following the data” really looks like."

The specifics will vary by product and market context, but essentially, every product manager wants the same thing: to build products that customers find valuable.**\nMakes sense. If COVID-19 can teach us anything about product management, it’s this: there’s no room for products that don’t bring value to the customer. The pandemic has put every single product and service to a value test. It has also put every single business to an agility test: How quickly can you adapt and pivot when the lives of your users change dramatically?\nThat, of course, depends on how well you understand your users—which depends, in turn, on your ability to ask the right questions and use data to get the answers you need. From defining product value, to measuring it and prioritizing what’s next, this book is about using product analytics to build a sustainable path for growth.\nWe wrote this book in collaboration with dozens of product leaders, people who earned their stripes at companies like Google, Twitter, LinkedIn, and ZipRecruiter. We wrote it for product managers, but it’s really for anyone who wants to deeply understand how people use products—without coding or asking a data analytics team. Because when more people can ask product questions and get answers quickly, companies move faster, build better products, and create more value for everyone.\nThe questions in this book are grouped into broad but practical categories that will help you learn such important things as:\n- What exactly do I need to measure in my product?\n- How do I account for different types of users in my analysis?\n- How do I narrow my focus around a single conversion flow to iterate faster?\n- Where are my best users coming from?\nLastly, we are a product analytics company, so throughout the book, we’ll show you some hands-on examples of how you can answer these questions with Mixpanel. And just like with any digital product today, this book will be continuously updated. You can find the most up-to-date version at [mixpanel.com/content/guide-to-product-analytics/](https://mixpanel.com/content/guide-to-product-analytics/).\nA2A"

Working with 250K companies in 188 countries, DocuSign helps individuals and companies go fully digital to help them keep life and business moving forward.\nDocuSign prides itself on offering a world-class experience for organizations of every size, industry, and geography. It’s one of the few companies whose technology touches its customers’ customers. Called “Signers” by DocuSign, many of them have never electronically signed anything before experiencing DocuSign.\n“Making sure that DocuSign is easy to use so that our customers’ agreements get returned completed and signed as fast as possible is key to our customers’ success,” says Drew Ashlock, Senior Product Manager. “We want our customers and their customers to love the experience of DocuSigning because that’s what fuels the network effect and virality.”"

In fact, this network effect of its core product flow brings in 130,000 new unique users every day. Key to scaling for this massive growth is having fast, easy, and targeted product analytics.\n“We measure our success by our customers’ success,” Drew notes. “Successful Transactions — the number of documents that our customers successfully complete using DocuSign — is our one key metric. It ensures that every employee is aligned to making it as easy and fast as possible for customers to complete their transactions on the DocuSign Global Trust Network.”\n> Mixpanel helps us enable our customers for success. What started as a need for simple marketing metrics turned into custom product metrics for more than 100 different stakeholders across the company.\n>\n> **Drew Ashlock** Senior Product Manager"

          "content": "DocuSign uses Mixpanel in a variety of ways across the company. As DocuSign’s needs have grown over time, Mixpanel has easily grown with them. “When we originally started using Mixpanel in 2013, it was just for marketing,” says Drew. “We wanted to better understand how many users were actually converting to paid customers.”\n“Then we wanted to ensure Signers were able to be successful and complete documents,” Drew continues, “because increasing successful Signers helps grow use of DocuSign and the total number of Successful Transactions.”\nToday, DocuSign uses Mixpanel at every step of the customer journey, from acquiring new users to converting those users into paid customers. “As long as our Successful Transactions are growing, that means continued success for our customers and continued growth for our company.”\n“With Mixpanel, everybody can see who made it through the funnel.”\n### Using Funnels to test features\nMost users are accustomed to DocuSign’s generous freemium features, so Drew and his product team knew there were numerous opportunities to encourage free users towards upgrading as they used DocuSign more.\nThey reasoned that by exposing certain gated premium features, they would incentivize more free users to upgrade. “When we decided to expose some premium features to our free users,” says Drew, “we used super properties and Funnels to track which features drove conversions for our free users.”\nThe team’s [Funnels](https://mixpanel.com/funnels/) demonstrated that feature walls resulted in a 5% lift in upgrade conversions. “Given that we see 130,000 new unique users every day, this is a significant boost for us,” says Drew.\n### Improving account creation with A/B testing\nDocuSign used Mixpanel to monitor an A/B test to see if it could increase another important metric: New Signer Accounts.\nNew Signers are able to create a free account after signing a document. The free account retains a copy of the signed document and allows Signers to use DocuSign as a Sender.\nUsing Mixpanel to monitor this essential funnel, DocuSign increased free account creation by 15%.\n“Where the value of Mixpanel comes in is in being able to monitor that viral funnel to ensure New Signer success,” says Drew.\n### Boosting first-time user conversions\nPrior to Mixpanel, DocuSign didn’t have a clear window into new user behavior. When the team noted a significant drop off in conversions immediately after the initial sign up, they turned to Mixpanel to understand why.\nDocuSign suspected it was missing a step in the onboarding process and decided to test the impact of a separate user experience for new users.\n“Initially, we were leaning on our UI and let new users explore our web app on their own,” says Drew. “But with Mixpanel, we could monitor how users interact with the web app as we test and launch new features.”\n“Now, we walk customers through sending a document when they log into our web app for the first time,” says Drew. By adding this curated “first user” experience, DocuSign boosted Signer-to-Sender conversions by 10%."

          "content": "With the help of Mixpanel, Drew and his team were able to boost conversions, improve onboarding completion, and get more paid customers to upgrade. Going forward, DocuSign is using Mixpanel to make its overall data more impactful.\nAs DocuSign grows, it continues to accumulate a massive quantity of data across data stores old and new. “We’re building a data ecosystem now, gradually adding more data that we want people to have easier access to,” says Drew.\n“We’re integrating all the data that actually powers DocuSign into a data warehouse, adding event-based user tracking across all our different applications, and syncing up with billing data, back end data, and email data. It’s going to be great to have all of that disparate data available in a single place where we can query it,” Drew says.\n“Being able to then tie Mixpanel events to our backend data is going to be big for us. Mixpanel helps make our data more valuable.”\nMixpanel makes it easy for teams to explore and understand their data. No delays.
